(Tea Estate Becomes Wei's Property)

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.560
You must allow me
to buy you dinner, Mr. Qi.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.440
Thank you for taking care of my wife.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000
You're too kind, Mr. Li.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160
Xiaotang and I are friends.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.240
Let me cover this meal.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.040
That wouldn't be appropriate.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.200
My wife and I insist on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.800
buying you this meal.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.720
It doesn't matter.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.120
Besides, aren't you two divorced?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920
In that case,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.680
we're now simply friends.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.840
I enjoy treating friends to meals.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.760
This is my treat.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.240
My treat.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.720
My treat.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.960
My treat.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.920
My treat.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.728
I'll pay.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:38.280
I'll pay.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.720
- I...
- Wait, both of you.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.280
Please stop.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.160
Let's split the bill today.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.400
Split the bill.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.840
What is that?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.368
Mr. Qi, you don't

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:51.560
know my wife.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.992
She often speaks nonsense

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:54.240
that others can't understand.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.440
Only I understand her.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.080
Thank you for rescuing me

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.920
from jail, Mr. Qi.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.000
I swear

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.336
I will repay your favor.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.040
Xiaotang and I are deeply in love.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.280
Her tireless efforts to save me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.120
have deeply moved me.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800
I'll be with her forever.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.640
Naturally.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.040
She ran around for you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.120
and even lost weight.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.600
Miss Xiaotang,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
try some pork.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.320
This tavern has great dishes.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.480
I ordered this for you.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.360
Try it.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.760
Go ahead.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.360
Enough, that's plenty.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.120
Honey.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.880
My name has been cleared.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.840
I'll propose again tomorrow

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.480
to finalize the unfinished matters
in the contract.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.640
Unfinished matters?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.800
Like what?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.160
I can help.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.920
Don't be shy.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.400
It's private?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.960
Yeah.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.200
Quite private.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.840
It's a secret?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.240
A secret, indeed.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.760
Yeah, indeed.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.720
Mr. Qi,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.000
I'll take care of my wife.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.040
No need for concern.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.360
Didn't you two get divorced?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640
But she is still my wife.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.280
No, she's not since you're divorced.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.200
I'll propose again tomorrow.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.520
She'll be my wife again.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.120
Then I'll propose tomorrow as well.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.200
- Mr. Qi, this is improper...
- Mr. Li.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.520
Can you drink?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.320
- Yes, of course. Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.320
Bottoms up.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.640
Go on.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.000
Keep going.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.560
(Persians and escort agencies
not served)

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.280
You should stop

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.680
meeting Mr. Qi.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.760
He's too frivolous.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.640
Are you jealous?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.320
You are jealous.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.680
No.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.960
Still denying it?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.160
I'm jealous.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.760
Finally.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.040
I only asked Mr. Qi

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.600
to help me

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.960
find Hassan

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.720
and get you out of jail.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.640
Also,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.080
we have business dealings.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.160
What kind of business dealings?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.680
We're planning

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680
a courier service.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.400
Courier... service?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.720
What's that?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.160
It's a fast logistics method featuring

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.480
small batches with high efficiency.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.720
Small batches with high efficiency?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.480
For example.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.424
What would you do if the tea houses

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:17.560
in neighboring cities
want to purchase tea

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.600
from us?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.880
For small quantities,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
transportation costs would be too high.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.080
That's where courier services
come into play.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.600
The Qi family's escort agency

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.760
delivers goods
to neighboring cities anyway.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.200
They can simply include our goods

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.320
and we only

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.840
have to pay a small fee

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.360
for that.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.000
In that case,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.320
the products of Li's Tea Estate
could reach markets

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.640
nationwide.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.960
Finally catching on.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.840
Business comes first.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.480
And our top priority right now

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.840
is to win the Top Tea title.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.680
We need more publicity.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.360
We need to sell our products

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.760
across the entire nation.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.400
Alright.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.920
One more thing.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.360
Madam Tang has brought your uncle

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.280
back to Li Manor.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.240
I saw it coming while I was imprisoned.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.960
So,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.200
even if you return now,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.920
they might not hand over

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.760
the entire family business to you.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.880
They used to be merely parasites
feeding on the Li family

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.120
and were hard to eradicate.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.400
Now, it's different.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.600
They have taken over

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.920
the family business.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.840
This actually gives us

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.320
a perfect chance to wipe them out.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.960
You're reading my mind.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.920
What's your plan?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.120
Those Persian merchants

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.320
came to Haiqing

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.400
to buy tea leaves.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.840
They've already contacted

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.240
most local tea shops.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.680
Every merchant in Haiqing is wondering

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.040
what kind of tea

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.960
the Persians prefer.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.200
The Bait-and-Harvest strategy.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.360
We can set a trap.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.960
To destroy someone,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.760
first make them go crazy.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.840
Not bad.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.160
Listen carefully.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.960
From now on, we will only

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.680
purchase the large-leaf tea.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.480
We'll pay double the market price.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.320
Sign these contracts.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.160
From now on,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.480
preserve this type of tea solely for us.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.280
Understood?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.880
Sign the contracts.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.960
Thank you, sir.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.920
Thank you, sir.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.520
This settles everything.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.320
Uncle.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.920
People aren't accustomed

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.120
to the large-leaf tea.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.360
Why are you paying so much for them?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.000
My silly nephew.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.680
I've negotiated
with the Persian merchants.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.120
Their people

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.720
crave this type of tea.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.320
By cornering the market now,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.840
we can set whatever price we want.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.440
This is "hoarding and profiteering".

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.600
Watch and learn.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.000
There's more to business than you think.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.320
Uncle.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.360
But

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.560
why are you using

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.040
my mother's seal on these contracts

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.520
instead of Li family's?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.320
You're short-sighted,
like your mother says.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.960
What do we gain
if we get the tea for the Li family?

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.640
We must keep it in our private stash

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.000
so that they can't intervene.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640
Besides,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.560
we must seize the chance

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.280
to secure control
over the family business.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.640
Uncle, you're a genius.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.920
Have some.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.120
You there.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.600
Fetch some sunflower seeds.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.520
Coming.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.360
My lady.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.480
Master

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.160
has bought all the large-leaf tea

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.360
at premium prices.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.000
Good.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680
It seems

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
our moment has arrived.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.464
Why did those Persian merchants

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:19.320
change their minds?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.520
Sir, we have no idea.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.800
We delivered the tea.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.520
But they said

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.520
their people never drink tea,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.840
and they never asked for large-leaf tea.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.560
Nonsense.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.760
Just days ago, they bought

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.712
all our large-leaf tea

00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:33.040
at triple the price.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.240
How can they change their mind?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.080
We're totally played

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.560
if they don't buy our tea.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.040
Play?

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.480
Uncle, where are we going to play?

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.320
Get lost...

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.200
You're both here.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.600
I wonder

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.720
who's currently managing

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.120
the tea business here.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.000
Zimo and Uncle are in charge.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.320
Why are you two here?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.160
I'm here

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.720
to collect debts.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.760
Look,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.880
here's the contract you signed

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.360
with the tea farmers.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.768
They have delivered

00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:17.920
the goods to the doorstep.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.320
Shouldn't you settle the payment?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.920
I forgot to tell you.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.880
Those tea farmers have sold

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.680
their plantations to us.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.880
So you essentially signed

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.520
the contracts with us.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.720
Xiaotang... Miss Wei.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:36.992
Those...

00:10:36.992 --> 00:10:39.320
Those Persian merchants tricked us.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.560
First, they set up Zixuan.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.656
Now, they've scammed us.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.880
We don't have a single penny left.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.120
Please, give me some time.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.080
I'll make things right

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.680
with the Persian merchants.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.880
- I'll go right now.
- Fine.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.000
I'll go to the authorities

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.880
tomorrow.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.680
If you can't repay,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.792
we'll claim

00:10:57.792 --> 00:10:59.280
- the Li Manor.
- No, don't.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.720
Miss Wei.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.440
Please show some leniency.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.680
Uncle.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.320
I'm not playing your game.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.920
I do value our past ties,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.560
but business is business. See?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.624
Zixuan, hold this.

00:11:10.624 --> 00:11:13.280
It's all written in black and white.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.600
The Li's Tea Estate
belongs to the Wei family now.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920
Alright.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.040
You two are taking advantage
of our crisis.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.040
Uncle, we're not
taking advantage of you.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.960
We're only reclaiming what's ours.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.040
Now that I look carefully,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.840
many of these contracts

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.800
were signed by you personally.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.240
I can settle the debts

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.120
of the Li family.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.240
But these debts of yours...

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.920
Look.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640
Tang Er'gou.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.080
872 liang.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.480
Uncle, that's a lot of money.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.600
Uncle,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.680
how about this?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.600
Out of respect for our past ties,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.080
I'll give you some time.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.600
Repay slowly.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
Even if it takes your whole lifetime,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.080
I'll wait.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.400
Uncle, you'll have a hard road ahead.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.200
Uncle, you're a genius.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.160
My lady said that

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.120
your clothes are worth one liang.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.600
You've worn them
without washing for half a month.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.040
It counts as 0.8 liang.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.960
That means,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.360
you still owe us 871.2 liang.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.600
Judging from the wages
of a common tea laborer,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.616
you can earn

00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:41.440
at most 1.6 liang every month.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.840
Even if you only eat
steamed buns and pickles,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.760
you can save
no more than 1 liang a month.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.720
At this rate,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.480
it'll take you 80 years
to repay the debt.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.160
My lady wanted to remind you

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.248
that you must stay healthy

00:12:53.248 --> 00:12:54.200
and live a long life.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.160
Otherwise,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.320
we'll collect debts

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.360
at your grave.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.880
Father,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.960
have some tea.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.120
The accountant told me

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.280
you diverted funds
to buy tea from farmers.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.040
Is this true?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.160
Father,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.520
I was just helping your son-in-law

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.800
Zixuan.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.080
You've already divorced.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.720
He's no longer part of our family.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.480
How could you use our money

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.040
to settle the debts of the Li family?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.920
Father, you're mistaken.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.808
Once we remarry,

00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:45.800
the money will be ours.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.800
The Li family treated you so poorly,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.840
yet you want to remarry that man?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440
I will never

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.960
let you remarry him.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.720
Father.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.440
From now on,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.760
you're not to leave

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.920
without my permission.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.440
Get dressed.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.800
What a disgrace.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.800
Sister.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.520
Wei Xiaotang

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.760
set me up.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.760
Enough.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040
They set a trap

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.280
and you fell for it

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.000
like a fool. Pathetic!

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.280
You can't go back to the tea estate.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.000
Stay here from now on.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.600
At least I can provide for you.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.440
But we'll have no part

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.800
in the business anymore.
