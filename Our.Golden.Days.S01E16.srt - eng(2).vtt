00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.976
- Ji Hyuk! - My gosh. You came.

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:05.686
I'm back.

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:07.246
Grandma, Mom.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:09.386
What do you mean, you're back?

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:14.126
- I mean I'm home, Mom. - So you came back for good?

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.556
That's right.

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:17.826
I've come back to live with you again.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:20.166
- Oh, that's wonderful. I'm so glad. - Ji Hyuk.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.566
Oh, I'm so glad. Where have you been all this time?

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:27.066
I even tried texting and calling from numbers you wouldn't recognise,

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:29.106
but you just went and changed your number.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:32.476
- I'm sorry. - I'm just so glad you're home.

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:33.576
Ji Hyuk!

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.275
- What's going on? - It's so good to have you back.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:38.586
- Ji Hyuk! - Hey, Ji Wan. Can you get my bags?

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.586
Oh, my goodness. Just look at me.

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:42.556
- Goodness me. - But what's with this suitcase?

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:47.626
- Your brother's home for good. - Really? He's going to live here?

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:50.956
What? After I lugged your heavy bags for you?

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:56.066
- What's this? - This? It's for Mom and Grandma.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:01:00.236
My gosh, you didn't have to get us anything.

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:04.676
- Thank you, Ji Hyuk. - Don't mention it.

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.696
It's all for you. Eat up.

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.966
Mom, I don't deserve all this. You really went all out.

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:36.376
I feel so guilty.

00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:39.306
You came back to us in one piece.

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:41.446
What?

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:45.916
You don't mean you all thought something had happened to me?

00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:47.416
What else were we supposed to think?

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:49.656
After you went and changed your phone number.

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:52.056
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:53.826
I really am sorry.

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.326
- At the time, I just... - It's okay.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:00.166
I'm just so happy you walked back in on your own.

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:03.896
Come on. You thought he was just dropping in for a meal.

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.905
That's what I thought,

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:07.636
but I'm so proud he made this decision.

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:10.806
How did you come to such a mature decision?

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:12.176
You're proud of me?

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:14.646
Mom, are you feeling all right?

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:17.116
Seriously, why would you be proud of a brat like me?

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:21.216
Hey. For a parent, nothing else matters.

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.315
What matters is that my child has come home safe.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:24.616
That's the most important thing.

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.796
That doesn't mean you're completely off the hook, though.

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:34.196
I know.

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:39.436
I can finally relax, knowing you'll be living at home.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:41.376
Right, Mother?

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:44.306
It feels like my feet are finally back on solid ground.

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:48.016
But where's Dad?

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:51.016
Is he avoiding me because I'm back?

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:54.816
No. He doesn't know you're here.

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:58.626
Dad's going to a prep school for an Electrical Tech license.

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:02.596
To be an electrical technician? But Dad's a humanities guy.

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:05.525
After he gets the license and gets about a year of work experience,

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:07.926
he'll get an industrial electrician certification as well.

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:11.366
When's the exam?

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:14.306
Whenever I ask him, he just says it's still a ways off.

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:22.446
Okay, enough talk. The eel is getting cold.

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.146
- Go on and eat, Ji Hyuk. - Yes, let's eat.

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:27.286
- You should eat too, Mother. - Thank you for the meal.

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:31.356
- It's eel! - This looks delicious.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:34.486
This is so good it's making me tear up.

00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:41.226
- Let's try some. - You have the first bite.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:42.766
It's delicious, Mom.

00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:45.136
Hey, you.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.006
You haven't had dinner, have you?

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:51.546
- I already ate. - Was that pastry all you're having?

00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:53.946
Let's go grab some dinner together.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:55.876
I'm not hungry.

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:02.816
Your stomach says you are.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:08.656
How about some gukbap and soju? What do you say?

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:10.656
I'll just eat when I get home.

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:21.806
What kind of business are you doing? Where did you even get the money?

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:25.746
I'm not using my own money. I have investors.

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:27.276
Investors?

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.246
Oh, so it must be going well then.

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:33.216
Su Bin, let's talk about all this later, okay?

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.816
Yes, lay off. What's important is he's back and healthy.

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:39.586
Ji Wan. Listen to you, what a hypocrite.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.526
You were the one who talked the most trash about him.

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:44.296
Hey, that was different.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:47.966
Hey, it's time for me to head back.

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:51.766
Right, you normally work late. How long will you be doing this?

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:54.736
Actually, it's a pretty good fit for me.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:56.306
The driving part?

00:04:56.376 --> 00:05:01.076
No, driving isn't my main focus. My main job is being a bodyguard.

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:02.746
I'm heading out.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:05.286
- You, little... - Bye.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:10.316
Look at him go. He never sits still.

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:12.726
I guess Ji Wan really must enjoy it.

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:17.156
Maybe since he works for Seong Jae, Ji Wan is taking this seriously.

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:20.066
He has to be there by 9am, but he always leaves at 8am.

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:24.236
Ji Hyuk. So, this whole time... Where were you?

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.006
Am I not even supposed to ask you that?

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:28.336
Please, just drop it.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.846
Man, I'm starving today.

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:40.716
This is delicious, right?

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.716
It's been a while.

00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.686
- Is Ji Wan back already? - It's been a long time, right?

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:49.596
- I'll get this. - Oh, honestly...

00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:58.666
Sang Cheol, you came home so early today.

00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:02.636
- Yes. What's going on, honey? - Dad! Ji Hyuk's here.

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:04.376
I'm home, Father.

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:07.576
What are you doing in my house?

00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:08.946
Honey.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.416
For everything...

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:16.386
- I'm sorry for everything. - Well, forget all that.

00:06:16.756 --> 00:06:18.786
Answer my question. What are you doing in my house?

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.856
It was time for me to come home.

00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:25.366
What? Time to come home? What do you mean, "It was time?"

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:28.236
What are you doing waltzing in here? Who said you could?

00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:29.866
I didn't come back for your sake, Father.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.606
I came back for Mom.

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.406
Doesn't Mom own half of this house?

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:36.976
Even if your name is on the deed.

00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:39.546
What? What did you just say?

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:44.646
You don't think this house is yours just because you paid, do you?

00:06:45.486 --> 00:06:48.456
Hey, I've never even thought that, you little punk.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:50.886
Then we're good.

00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:52.786
What do you mean, "we're good?"

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:55.856
This brat still thinks he's right.

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:59.496
Not being right isn't the same as being wrong.

00:06:59.966 --> 00:07:01.496
You're saying you weren't in the wrong?

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.795
So you think you can leave on a whim...

00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:06.006
and just waltz back in as you please?

00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:11.206
- I'm sorry. - Sang Cheol, that's enough.

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:12.446
She's right.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.576
Ji Hyuk, why don't you just go upstairs?

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:17.616
- I'll just go upstairs. - Where do you think you're going?

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:20.986
Oh, is that right?

00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:24.516
A 50-percent stake. Fine. I get it.

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:27.156
But in return, while you are in this house,

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:28.726
stay out of my sight, you brat!

00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:48.646
Dinner is ready in the kitchen. Come and eat.

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:51.746
Why didn't you tell me? Did you decide this all on your own?

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:55.156
How could you let him in this house without saying a single word to me?

00:07:59.056 --> 00:08:03.256
I bought eel to cook for you, but you said you weren't coming.

00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:05.596
Suddenly, I thought of Ji Hyuk.

00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:09.266
So I called him on the off chance he could come over and eat.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:13.806
While you were going to be out. Yes, to feed him and see how he was.

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:16.806
But he showed up with his bags all packed.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:21.406
So you didn't beg him to move back in?

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:23.016
I didn't.

00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:26.916
But I thought it was a good chance for you to see Ji Hyuk too,

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:28.716
so that's why I called you again.

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.726
I feared you wouldn't come if I said Ji Hyuk was here beforehand.

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:35.496
No, but before you welcomed him back with open arms,

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:38.526
you should have told him you'd have to talk to me first.

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:41.096
How could you say that about our son who just came home?

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.536
You know what? Let's just drop it.

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:48.306
We chose to have him. Did he ask to be born?

00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:50.836
What?

00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:52.546
You know it's true.

00:08:52.976 --> 00:08:54.706
So no matter what,

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:57.176
we're responsible for him because he's our child.

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:01.616
Whatever. You've got it all figured out.

00:09:18.736 --> 00:09:19.866
Does it smell?

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:24.936
- I washed them every week. - No, I mean it smells nice.

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.846
Wait, you washed them every week?

00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:30.876
Because I never knew when you'd be back.

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.956
I guess this is one of those moments.

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:39.426
I'm speechless, Mom.

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.626
There's so much I want to say,

00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:43.656
I just don't know where to begin.

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:45.566
I know.

00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:48.466
Don't say anything. It'll come out when the time's right.

00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:52.136
So, Dad wants to be an electrical technician?

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.166
You didn't stop him? You should have.

00:09:54.466 --> 00:09:56.706
How could I? You know how stubborn your father is.

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:59.576
Once he says he'll do it, he does. That's your dad for you.

00:10:00.776 --> 00:10:04.646
Anyway, you should get some rest. I thought you had an early start.

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:06.616
Yes.

00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:11.156
Ji Hyuk.

00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:15.086
I'm so grateful you've come back safe and sound.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:36.876
Hey, stop!

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:52.026
What? What are you doing?

00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:53.866
I'm taking a shower.

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:58.166
What? I really have to go. How can you just cut in front of me?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.476
That doesn't sound like a shower. I really have to go!

00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:08.516
- Grandma! Hurry up! - What is it?

00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:14.716
Son, it's me. This is an emergency. Son!

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:17.456
- Mother? - Yes, it's me.

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:18.826
Just a second.

00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:25.996
- Right, okay. - See? You weren't even showering.

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:29.296
Hey, is there a law that says you must wash your hair in a shower?

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:34.336
Sang Cheol.

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:36.606
"Mom owns half of this house?" How dare he.

00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:38.946
Then let's split the bathroom in half. That little...

00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:48.516
(Chondroitin 1200 for Your Joints)

00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:55.156
What's that? What kind of medicine are you and Mother taking?

00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:57.796
Are you sick? Mother, are you not feeling well?

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.066
No, it's a gift from Ji Hyuk. It's for my sore knees.

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:07.406
Mother has trouble getting up. How did he know to get this for us?

00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:09.036
Do you want some too?

00:12:09.476 --> 00:12:10.806
On second thought, no.

00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:14.176
He's always running up the mountain behind the house.

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:17.346
Of course. He even runs half-marathons.

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:19.986
His knees are solid as a rock.

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:22.956
Then I guess I don't need any. I'm fine.

00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:26.926
You sound a little jealous, though.

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:30.526
Jealous? You don't understand me at all.

00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:34.596
This kid, doing whatever it takes to kiss up to his mom. Incredible.

00:12:34.696 --> 00:12:38.036
Oh, Ji Hyuk brought some fruit. Why don't you have some of that?

00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:40.736
No, Mother. I'm good. You go ahead and have some.

00:12:50.116 --> 00:12:53.286
- Ta-da! - Oh, my goodness.

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:57.216
It's not your day off. What's all this for?

00:12:57.816 --> 00:13:00.626
The Mapo project is finished, so I don't have to leave so early.

00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:03.995
I wanted to make you breakfast since it's been so long.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:05.256
Oh, my.

00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:07.366
And I have something to tell you.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.736
About what?

00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:13.106
Let's eat first. It's nothing serious.

00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:14.936
Go on.

00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:21.406
My daughter makes the best French toast.

00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:26.516
- Mom. - Yes?

00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:27.616
So...

00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:30.756
You know how I was always worried about not getting enough work?

00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:32.756
Well, I don't have to be anymore.

00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:34.926
I'm going into a partnership.

00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:38.426
- A partnership? - Yes.

00:13:39.326 --> 00:13:42.396
A company in a similar field made me an offer,

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:44.436
and I've decided to go into business with them.

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:47.566
They get lots of turnkey requests, you see.

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:50.836
But, sweetie.

00:13:51.306 --> 00:13:53.806
After your dad's business failed, you always said...

00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:57.646
you'd stay on your own until the business was stable,

00:13:57.716 --> 00:14:00.846
then hire one person and stay small. You wanted to keep it small.

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:06.486
So what's this about a partnership? Why the sudden change of mind?

00:14:07.186 --> 00:14:10.626
That's why we're just doing a three-month trial first.

00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:13.666
So let's just leave it at that.

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:23.576
Oh, that's right. I have a breakfast meeting today.

00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:25.906
- I'll see you later. - What?

00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:31.216
But...

00:14:32.346 --> 00:14:34.516
She fixed this whole breakfast,

00:14:35.486 --> 00:14:36.886
so what's this about a breakfast meeting?

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.576
I guess you didn't stay here last night?

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:01.506
I'm not staying here anymore.

00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:03.216
I'm commuting from home.

00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:05.216
You moved back home?

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:09.986
You're awfully curious about your partner's private life,

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:11.386
Ms. Ji.

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:19.266
Let's have a quick meeting.

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:23.936
The Gangha-dong apartment client wants a French-inspired style.

00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:27.236
I think Designer Kim Ji Seon would be a good match for them.

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:28.876
And for the Mangin-dong villa,

00:15:29.176 --> 00:15:31.436
I was thinking we could assign that to Designer Lee Ri Na.

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:34.846
I thought you'd pick your own project first.

00:15:35.946 --> 00:15:37.216
You must be waiting for a specific project.

00:15:38.786 --> 00:15:39.886
If it were up to me...

00:15:41.646 --> 00:15:42.786
I'd start with this one.

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:48.126
Oh, I see. We haven't heard back from them yet.

00:15:49.396 --> 00:15:50.396
That's right.

00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:53.796
All right. I'll tell Mr. Jo to draw up their contracts.

00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:56.996
- Is that everything? - Yes.

00:15:57.536 --> 00:15:58.536
What?

00:15:59.336 --> 00:16:00.336
What's going on?

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:03.436
- Why is everyone in so early? - What about you?

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:04.976
I have a coffee bean delivery today.

00:16:06.506 --> 00:16:07.776
Having a meeting already?

00:16:08.276 --> 00:16:10.616
Bingo. And it's over.

00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:14.086
Oh, by the way, you're looking well today.

00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:15.686
I always look this good.

00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:21.426
That's not what I meant...

00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:24.226
He moved back home.

00:16:24.326 --> 00:16:26.796
Oh, really? He went back to his old place?

00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:31.266
- Oh, good morning. - Right.

00:16:31.466 --> 00:16:32.536
Good morning.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.946
What's with everyone? Why are you all such early birds?

00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:48.916
Hey, you're in early.

00:16:51.986 --> 00:16:53.426
This isn't connected, you see.

00:16:54.856 --> 00:16:57.256
Then why are you wearing the headset?

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.666
People don't talk to me when I wear it.

00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:03.536
Right, good point.

00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:06.906
All right, get to work. I'll text you if I need anything.

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:13.146
Mom.

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:15.306
We need to go dress shopping.

00:17:17.716 --> 00:17:19.486
I have plenty of gowns to wear to recitals.

00:17:22.186 --> 00:17:25.786
The Berlin Phil concert calls for something more elegant.

00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:29.596
He didn't say it was the Berlin Phil.

00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:33.026
He asked if I liked classical music, and when I said yes,

00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:35.126
he just suggested we go see a concert.

00:17:35.696 --> 00:17:39.936
Hyeonyu Group is the main sponsor of the Berlin Philharmonic concerts.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:42.276
I see.

00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:46.006
I'll schedule it for sometime this week.

00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:48.406
Okay.

00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:51.176
Okay, get ready. All right?

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:05.866
My heart just won't stop racing.

00:18:06.496 --> 00:18:08.466
And with Yeong Ra's exhibition coming up,

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:11.566
I'm worried he might show up and cause a scene.

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.006
I even got a prescription for tranquillizers.

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:18.506
Tranquillizers?

00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:21.006
Why didn't you say something sooner?

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:23.646
I was waiting.

00:18:24.276 --> 00:18:25.946
You've been so busy lately.

00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:29.486
I know you always check on me when you get a chance.

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:34.026
I don't care how busy I am. For you to be this worried,

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:35.926
to the point where you'd ask for my help...

00:18:37.256 --> 00:18:38.796
All right. Don't worry.

00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:47.066
What? Are you telling me this huge motorcycle just vanished?

00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:50.906
After we received that panoramic photo,

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:54.746
I had my team go through the month's worth of CCTV footage...

00:18:55.506 --> 00:18:57.346
that we had stored from that time.

00:18:58.176 --> 00:19:00.546
But we found no footage of it leaving.

00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:08.586
What, did he hide the darn bike in his bedroom?

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:15.126
A truck.

00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:17.996
Excuse me?

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:19.965
You said there were no CCTV blind spots...

00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:21.606
between the area and the main road.

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:24.106
- Right. - After the bike went in,

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:28.106
have you looked into any trucks leaving that alley or neighbourhood?

00:19:30.076 --> 00:19:32.546
- No, we didn't think to... - Then I want you to check.

00:19:33.716 --> 00:19:37.156
If he's not caught by her exhibition and something happens,

00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:39.856
I won't just stand by and do nothing.

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.426
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:48.466
(Director Yun)

00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:51.166
Yes, Director Yun.

00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:52.806
Any good news?

00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:56.236
Still?

00:19:57.436 --> 00:19:58.506
I mean, how much longer?

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:01.576
Seriously, how long do I have to wait?

00:20:03.976 --> 00:20:07.316
What do you mean it's difficult? I went out of my way to ask you.

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:10.716
Fine. Understood for now.

00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:15.996
Darn it. I'm dead if Park Jin Seok finds out.

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:22.466
So you're forcing me to go there myself.

00:20:26.036 --> 00:20:30.136
Director, Ji Hyuk moved back home. He'll be commuting from now on.

00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.176
All of a sudden?

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:38.446
That's great.

00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:50.496
Here you go.

00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:53.796
- You really don't have to do this. - Just get in.

00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:06.146
- Hey, but... - One month.

00:21:07.776 --> 00:21:11.616
If I can win him over in a month, I'll tell him I'll quit my job...

00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:15.956
to be a full-time content creator. It's a promise, so let's seal it.

00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:19.326
Come on.

00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:24.496
Your thumb.

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:26.226
Hurry up.

00:21:29.066 --> 00:21:32.436
- Goodness, this is so childish. - Hey, wait a minute!

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:37.636
Hey. You've been talking to my brother, haven't you?

00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:40.776
- You knew where he was, didn't you? - Of course, I did.

00:21:40.846 --> 00:21:44.176
My gosh, I feel totally betrayed. And you didn't even tell me.

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:47.286
Hey, I'm Ji Hyuk's friend, not yours.

00:21:48.046 --> 00:21:49.046
That's true.

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:52.386
Okay, fine. I'll let that one slide,

00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:56.456
but you can't tell my brother about this little scheme of ours.

00:21:57.056 --> 00:21:59.026
I'm telling you. Ji Hyuk is home now.

00:21:59.726 --> 00:22:00.796
I know that, knucklehead.

00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:05.296
I'll give you the rules on the way, so take notes on your phone.

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:08.206
That's the whole reason I'm dropping you off nearby.

00:22:09.406 --> 00:22:10.476
Got it.

00:22:11.236 --> 00:22:13.646
(Shoealls)

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:19.616
Ms. Lee Su Bin?

00:22:20.346 --> 00:22:22.086
Hello. I'm Lee Su Bin.

00:22:22.686 --> 00:22:23.716
Right this way.

00:22:26.486 --> 00:22:30.626
Mr. Kang, this is Lee Su Bin. She'll be joining you as manager.

00:22:30.696 --> 00:22:32.356
And Su Bin, this is Assistant Manager Kang Seong Mo.

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:34.526
Hello. I'm Kang Seong Mo.

00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:37.696
I'm Lee Su Bin. It's a pleasure to work with you.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.636
You can get changed in the locker room.

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:42.206
(Lee Su Bin, Manager)

00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:44.606
Okay.

00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:51.676
This client got back to us quickly. They didn't make you wait.

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:53.586
I know.

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:58.286
So, what's the problem they wanted to discuss?

00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:02.026
There are 4 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.

00:23:02.126 --> 00:23:03.696
They want to remove one bedroom,

00:23:03.896 --> 00:23:07.526
add another bathroom, and open up the kitchen.

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:10.466
That means we'd have to redo all the plumbing and wiring.

00:23:10.536 --> 00:23:11.866
Sounds like a fun project.

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:13.806
And obviously,

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:16.576
the quote was high?

00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:21.446
But their budget is only 100,000 dollars.

00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:25.016
Then we'll have to reduce the work to fit their budget.

00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:32.986
Ms. Ji.

00:23:33.956 --> 00:23:35.156
What are you trying to get at?

00:23:38.156 --> 00:23:39.966
It's an old detached house,

00:23:40.526 --> 00:23:43.196
and the layout is fascinating, so I'd love to do it.

00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:44.836
Exactly.

00:23:45.366 --> 00:23:47.635
A 60 to 70-year-old house with a yard needs...

00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:48.966
a complete structural overhaul.

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:51.806
It's right up your alley, I'll admit.

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:56.575
We can cut 20,000 dollars if we use cheaper materials.

00:23:56.576 --> 00:23:58.216
Then just have them give up on moving the kitchen.

00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:01.586
Let me do it for the experience.

00:24:02.046 --> 00:24:05.716
I'll make up for the loss with other projects.

00:24:05.956 --> 00:24:07.056
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:24:07.856 --> 00:24:10.096
The client said she hated having a separate kitchen her whole life.

00:24:10.596 --> 00:24:12.426
She moved into this house right after she got married.

00:24:12.496 --> 00:24:16.336
Now, she wants to live here for the rest of her days.

00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:18.036
For every project you're in charge of,

00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:20.306
I get a five percent cut of the total construction cost.

00:24:21.936 --> 00:24:24.006
- Right, so on the next one, I'll... - Why should I?

00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:28.946
Ms. Ji Eun Oh. Are you running a charity?

00:24:29.246 --> 00:24:30.646
What is this, an art project?

00:24:31.046 --> 00:24:34.316
My cut is already factored into the profits of the next project.

00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:37.186
Why are you giving me an IOU for my cut?

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:39.956
And on our very first project as partners, no less.

00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:43.426
Do you think this partnership is some after-school club?

00:24:44.996 --> 00:24:46.326
I know it isn't.

00:24:46.666 --> 00:24:48.526
- I know, but... - Then don't be greedy.

00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:53.066
- Greedy? - Is money the only kind of greed?

00:24:53.866 --> 00:24:56.336
Insisting on getting your way is a kind of greed too.

00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:57.876
Especially with nothing to show for it.

00:25:03.276 --> 00:25:05.016
That five percent of the official quote.

00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:06.986
I can just pay you out of my own pocket, right?

00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:09.516
Absolutely not.

00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:12.015
- Why not? - That's not how business works.

00:25:12.016 --> 00:25:13.226
And it goes against my principles.

00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:16.326
The Suri-dong house project.

00:25:16.526 --> 00:25:19.125
If they accept the quote, we'll start.

00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:21.226
If they don't, revise the plans...

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:24.696
to fit their budget.

00:25:25.236 --> 00:25:27.136
My turnkey manager took losses...

00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:29.236
working on a project with my name on it?

00:25:29.606 --> 00:25:34.006
I won't tolerate rumours like that. They're here for Mamdaerozip.

00:25:35.246 --> 00:25:36.246
Just drop it.

00:25:39.786 --> 00:25:41.316
I'm going to get some air.

00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:51.456
So naive. That's why I wanted you as a partner.

00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:53.566
Gosh, as if I'm not busy enough.

00:26:11.876 --> 00:26:13.846
These are the client inquiries I've sorted for today.

00:26:15.186 --> 00:26:16.255
Another group project?

00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:19.386
Hyunmyeong Apartments went viral on the parenting forums.

00:26:19.656 --> 00:26:24.625
Multiple units doing demolition and rewiring at the same time...

00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:27.296
means all the noise is done at once. They love that.

00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:30.066
And our moving company partnership is a big hit too.

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:34.406
I see. Oh, hey, did you eat dinner?

00:26:35.366 --> 00:26:38.306
You bought me a sandwich when you came back from the site.

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:39.806
I did?

00:26:40.976 --> 00:26:41.976
Oh, right.

00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:45.676
- I'm done for the day. - Okay, great work.

00:26:54.386 --> 00:26:56.726
What the heck? She's still not back?

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:58.796
Come on, we have to finish our conversation.

00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:04.496
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:12.976
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.745
- Well, I'm going to take off. - Okay. Have a good night.

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:19.816
- See you the day after tomorrow. - Yes, get home safe.

00:27:19.886 --> 00:27:20.886
Have a good one.

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:33.496
I didn't come back for your sake, Father.

00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:35.296
It was time for me to come home.

00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:03.596
Oh, my goodness.

00:28:04.926 --> 00:28:06.156
If you drink it like this,

00:28:06.426 --> 00:28:08.966
you feel like you're drinking a lot even when you're not.

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:11.996
Who in the world drinks beer with a straw?

00:28:12.366 --> 00:28:15.436
Well, there's no law against it. Go on, try it.

00:28:28.546 --> 00:28:32.216
When you want a drink but can't really let loose,

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.126
that's when I use a straw.

00:28:34.726 --> 00:28:37.626
How do you read others so well when you're still so young?

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:42.625
When a man with an exam coming up isn't even studying...

00:28:42.626 --> 00:28:45.296
and is just clutching a beer? It's a dead giveaway.

00:28:45.366 --> 00:28:47.666
So what's your excuse, Ms. Ji?

00:28:49.506 --> 00:28:50.806
This?

00:28:53.206 --> 00:28:54.446
Because I'm incredibly frustrated.

00:28:55.876 --> 00:28:59.746
You know how it is? They're right, and you're still mad.

00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:02.116
Do I ever.

00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:03.456
I sure do.

00:29:03.516 --> 00:29:05.886
I've got a guy like that driving me crazy too, so I...

00:29:08.156 --> 00:29:11.096
Listen to this old man unloading all this on you, young lady.

00:29:11.826 --> 00:29:15.666
Hey, life is frustrating. What does age have to do with it?

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:20.836
So who could possibly get under our tough manager's skin?

00:29:27.376 --> 00:29:30.216
Hey, why isn't Ji Eun Oh back yet?

00:29:30.476 --> 00:29:32.046
I'm not sure.

00:29:32.546 --> 00:29:34.016
She didn't call you or anything?

00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:36.116
She just left with her cell phone, nothing else.

00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:37.916
It's been over an hour.

00:29:40.456 --> 00:29:41.886
I haven't heard anything from her.

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:50.496
She's not picking up.

00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:52.366
She'll turn up, I'm sure.

00:29:52.836 --> 00:29:55.636
If she's not even answering for you, isn't that weird?

00:29:56.476 --> 00:29:59.006
When Eun Oh gets really focused, she often misses calls.

00:29:59.436 --> 00:30:01.006
Try calling her again.

00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:03.646
I have plans. I need to wrap this up and get going.

00:30:07.686 --> 00:30:09.486
This girl, honestly.

00:30:15.956 --> 00:30:17.956
She should've called if she had to leave in the middle of a meeting.

00:30:18.056 --> 00:30:19.626
Besides, why did she have to storm out like that?

00:30:20.396 --> 00:30:23.336
She's never been this irresponsible. Why is she putting me through this?

00:30:25.036 --> 00:30:26.096
Wait a second.

00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:28.436
What if something happened to her?

00:30:30.436 --> 00:30:32.236
(112 Police)

00:30:33.446 --> 00:30:35.376
No. That's crazy.

00:30:39.176 --> 00:30:40.186
Seong Jae.

00:30:40.746 --> 00:30:41.746
(Park Seong Jae)

00:30:44.586 --> 00:30:45.586
(Park Seong Jae)

00:30:55.426 --> 00:30:57.296
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:08.276
(Missed Call, Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:31:10.246 --> 00:31:11.616
Ji Hyuk? I wonder what's up.

00:31:12.776 --> 00:31:14.346
You have a voice message.

00:31:15.716 --> 00:31:19.316
Why aren't you picking up? Seong Jae, are you with Ji Eun Oh?

00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:20.756
If you are, let me know right away.

00:31:21.456 --> 00:31:25.456
Ji Eun Oh is missing! She stormed out over 1.5 hours ago.

00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:27.296
And her phone is off!

00:31:31.436 --> 00:31:32.566
Missing?

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:45.476
Oh, Mr. Park.

00:31:46.176 --> 00:31:47.186
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:31:50.656 --> 00:31:52.716
Where are you coming from?

00:31:53.526 --> 00:31:55.856
- What about you? - I was just on my way home.

00:31:56.256 --> 00:31:57.356
What about you, Eun Oh?

00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:02.526
I just felt like taking a walk in the rain.

00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:04.296
Really?

00:32:04.636 --> 00:32:05.736
Why?

00:32:07.166 --> 00:32:10.735
Well, Ji Hyuk called saying you were missing,

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:14.106
- so I was out looking for you. - Missing?

00:32:14.846 --> 00:32:17.016
But I told him I was just going out for some air.

00:32:17.316 --> 00:32:21.845
Gone for 1.5 hours for "some air?" Who wouldn't be worried?

00:32:21.846 --> 00:32:23.816
Has it been that long already?

00:32:25.916 --> 00:32:30.196
I was stressed and had to step out. I met someone for a beer.

00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:32.026
Who'd you meet?

00:32:34.566 --> 00:32:35.566
A friend.

00:32:35.926 --> 00:32:37.566
Oh, you have a friend around here?

00:32:38.336 --> 00:32:39.336
I do now.

00:32:42.436 --> 00:32:43.736
I'd better call Ji Hyuk.

00:32:43.806 --> 00:32:45.936
Oh, no, it's okay. Don't bother.

00:32:46.036 --> 00:32:47.676
He's probably gone home for the day anyway.

00:32:48.276 --> 00:32:51.446
You know he moved back home, right?

00:32:51.776 --> 00:32:53.446
Oh, right.

00:32:54.016 --> 00:32:56.016
Right, so he actually goes home after work now.

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:01.626
Being partners isn't always easy, is it?

00:33:02.786 --> 00:33:03.796
No.

00:33:04.496 --> 00:33:08.525
It was silly, but I got so stressed earlier.

00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:10.396
Why? What aren't you seeing eye-to-eye on?

00:33:10.466 --> 00:33:12.895
No. It's not that.

00:33:12.896 --> 00:33:14.266
The problem was me.

00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:18.376
You've been bottling up your stress, haven't you, Eun Oh?

00:33:18.436 --> 00:33:21.306
Yes. We haven't gamed in a while, have we?

00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:23.346
I've been busy too.

00:33:23.846 --> 00:33:26.416
Speaking of which, should we make plans?

00:33:35.126 --> 00:33:36.656
How about tomorrow?

00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:39.196
Maybe after lunch?

00:33:39.796 --> 00:33:43.436
- Unbelievable. I was worried sick. - That sounds like fun.

00:33:43.796 --> 00:33:45.566
See? Gaming is an addiction.

00:33:47.836 --> 00:33:48.836
Ji Hyuk!

00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:53.946
I'm going to head in first.

00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:57.746
I'll message the group for Su Jeong. See you tomorrow.

00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.326
I knew I'd find you two messing around.

00:34:08.556 --> 00:34:09.786
No, we were just making plans.

00:34:12.026 --> 00:34:14.795
I heard you went home. Good.

00:34:14.796 --> 00:34:15.896
That was the right call.

00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:18.835
This isn't a safe neighbourhood. She just stormed out,

00:34:18.836 --> 00:34:20.536
so you can't just assume she'll be okay.

00:34:22.006 --> 00:34:23.105
- I just got here... - Was it so hard...

00:34:23.106 --> 00:34:24.936
to say something, that she's okay?

00:34:26.206 --> 00:34:28.006
- No, that's not it. - What's with you two?

00:34:28.676 --> 00:34:30.816
Why are you two meeting and giggling this late at night?

00:34:32.546 --> 00:34:35.245
I just found her five minutes ago.

00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:36.616
I was looking for her after you called.

00:34:36.756 --> 00:34:38.186
You should've called me the second you found her.

00:34:38.756 --> 00:34:40.356
What were you two so cheerfully talking about?

00:34:42.626 --> 00:34:43.626
Are you lecturing me?

00:34:43.856 --> 00:34:45.056
Are you trying to get me riled up?

00:34:45.656 --> 00:34:47.266
And that thing with you three hanging out all the time.

00:34:47.626 --> 00:34:49.596
You're leaving me out on purpose, aren't you?

00:34:50.836 --> 00:34:53.096
Of course. Would you tell someone like you?

00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:55.666
Ji Hyuk.

00:34:56.436 --> 00:34:58.976
Why do you think I have to tell you everything?

00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:01.706
Eun Oh and I have our own dynamic.

00:35:03.316 --> 00:35:04.316
Dynamic?

00:35:06.016 --> 00:35:07.016
While I was gone,

00:35:07.486 --> 00:35:09.016
did something happen between you two?

00:35:10.286 --> 00:35:11.286
Maybe.

00:35:11.616 --> 00:35:12.616
What is it?

00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:14.186
Would Eun Oh...

00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:17.756
want me to tell you what happened between the two of us?

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:20.396
Is that right?

00:35:21.496 --> 00:35:22.496
I suppose she wouldn't.

00:35:23.196 --> 00:35:26.036
Fine. Don't tell me. It's not like I cared anyway.

00:35:27.136 --> 00:35:29.236
I was asking because you were being so weird and secretive.

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:32.836
Why did Eun Oh storm out like that anyway?

00:35:33.406 --> 00:35:35.646
- Did you two have a disagreement? - That's not your business either.

00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:38.116
Then why were you looking for her, pale as a ghost?

00:35:38.716 --> 00:35:40.946
Because there was a reason to, you jerk.

00:35:41.286 --> 00:35:43.046
That's what I'm asking. What happened?

00:35:43.316 --> 00:35:44.816
You didn't hear anything from Eun Oh?

00:35:46.356 --> 00:35:47.356
About what?

00:35:47.726 --> 00:35:49.186
If she didn't tell you, then you don't need to know.

00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:51.726
Go on. I still have some work to do.

00:35:59.766 --> 00:36:01.106
What in the world happened?

00:36:16.186 --> 00:36:17.386
What should I do?

00:36:21.786 --> 00:36:22.886
Ms. Ji.

00:36:23.826 --> 00:36:24.826
Ji Eun Oh!

00:36:25.556 --> 00:36:26.556
Eun Oh!

00:36:27.626 --> 00:36:28.626
Would Eun Oh...

00:36:29.096 --> 00:36:32.236
want me to tell you what happened between the two of us?

00:36:39.606 --> 00:36:40.606
You fool.

00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:45.376
What were you thinking today?

00:36:57.526 --> 00:36:59.656
Honestly, 150,000 dollars is the right estimate.

00:37:03.836 --> 00:37:05.396
(Mamdaerozip Quote, Total 158,500 Dollars)

00:37:11.806 --> 00:37:12.906
Not heading out?

00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:17.116
No, I'm going to stay a bit longer.

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:18.716
What time is "a bit longer?"

00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:22.446
Why do you want to know?

00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:26.016
We don't have construction tomorrow, so let's just wrap up and head home.

00:37:26.486 --> 00:37:27.626
Because that's what I'd prefer.

00:37:50.846 --> 00:37:53.246
He's right. It's not like we're that busy yet.

00:38:12.066 --> 00:38:14.406
Your daughter hasn't been by at all lately.

00:38:14.836 --> 00:38:16.306
I know. She's been busy.

00:38:16.876 --> 00:38:19.376
It looks like you're just trying to keep busy too.

00:38:20.106 --> 00:38:22.846
- Sorry? - Are you worried about something?

00:38:24.276 --> 00:38:25.516
Oh, I shouldn't be so nosy.

00:38:26.016 --> 00:38:27.946
I'll be on my way now.

00:38:28.616 --> 00:38:29.986
All right. Bye.

00:38:35.786 --> 00:38:36.896
She's right.

00:38:38.596 --> 00:38:40.166
It's been quite a while since Eun Oh...

00:38:40.896 --> 00:38:41.996
stopped by.

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:46.366
She keeps coming home late too.

00:38:51.706 --> 00:38:53.375
Are you Gang Oh's mother?

00:38:53.376 --> 00:38:56.646
We're friends of Gang Oh's from high school.

00:38:56.776 --> 00:38:58.876
Gang Oh mentioned you run a Korean BBQ place around here.

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:01.086
So why's he working at a pickup bar?

00:39:01.586 --> 00:39:04.956
- Mom, I'm off. I'm late. - Okay.

00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:07.156
A pickup bar?

00:39:07.556 --> 00:39:09.186
Where is that?

00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:14.826
Oh, no. I...

00:39:15.526 --> 00:39:17.396
I can't believe I said that in front of Eun Oh.

00:39:20.366 --> 00:39:21.366
What have I done?

00:39:24.276 --> 00:39:26.006
Hey, I'm not just an employee here.

00:39:26.336 --> 00:39:27.346
Then what are you?

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:31.276
- I'm the owner. - My gosh. Seriously?

00:39:32.346 --> 00:39:34.446
My friends and I invested together to co-own it.

00:39:34.986 --> 00:39:36.316
That's why I work the floor too.

00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:39.686
You're an owner already? How old are you?

00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:42.826
Me? You first.

00:39:43.456 --> 00:39:45.226
- You can't be older than me. - What?

00:39:47.096 --> 00:39:50.596
Hey! Ji Gang Oh. Quit flirting with customers.

00:39:51.366 --> 00:39:55.006
Get in the kitchen, now! We're buried in dishes, you brat.

00:39:55.636 --> 00:39:56.836
What was that about?

00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:00.606
Unbelievable.

00:40:08.086 --> 00:40:10.916
Hey, Yang Jin Gu! Did you tell my mom I work here?

00:40:12.186 --> 00:40:15.426
I'm telling you, I clearly said it was the Couples' Bar in Hongdae.

00:40:15.486 --> 00:40:17.326
You think I'd get the name of our own bar wrong?

00:40:18.256 --> 00:40:19.796
Seriously... Yes, one second!

00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:26.396
Mom,

00:40:27.406 --> 00:40:28.966
how could you do this to me?

00:40:43.716 --> 00:40:44.716
What?

00:41:23.526 --> 00:41:24.626
You came for this, didn't you?

00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:28.166
You punk. Knowing it wasn't yours, you should have returned it.

00:41:29.526 --> 00:41:32.336
It looks like you were using my room as your study.

00:41:32.996 --> 00:41:34.336
Is it inconvenient that I'm here now?

00:41:34.836 --> 00:41:36.406
What, you think I need a special place to study?

00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:38.206
I can do it anywhere.

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:39.736
Father.

00:41:41.346 --> 00:41:42.706
Have you really thought this through?

00:41:43.306 --> 00:41:44.316
What about?

00:41:44.946 --> 00:41:46.146
An electrician's license.

00:41:46.576 --> 00:41:48.816
It's pretty far removed from your old line of work.

00:41:49.986 --> 00:41:52.016
And you? What about you?

00:41:52.186 --> 00:41:54.226
I hear you're starting some unheard-of business.

00:41:54.756 --> 00:41:55.756
Why don't you worry about yourself?

00:42:08.106 --> 00:42:09.336
This kid... I swear.

00:42:10.476 --> 00:42:12.236
Gosh, that's ridiculous. The nerve of him.

00:42:12.936 --> 00:42:14.246
Yes, you punk. Just you watch.

00:42:14.576 --> 00:42:16.476
I'm Lee Sang Cheol. You got that?

00:42:16.946 --> 00:42:18.445
He opens a pathetic business...

00:42:18.446 --> 00:42:20.116
and thinks he can talk to me like that.

00:42:25.616 --> 00:42:28.656
My exam is today, of all days. That clueless kid had to jinx me.

Yes! It's been ages since the crew assembled.

That's on me. I've been so swamped.

00:43:29.786 --> 00:43:32.086

You're playing video games, right?

00:46:02.536 --> 00:46:05.406
It's so obvious. There's Seong Jae, who gets bored,

Eun Oh, who's totally impulsive, and Su Jeong, who was a big gamer.

Wait, what was I even doing?

00:46:52.016 --> 00:46:54.326
It's not like Seong Jae and Eun Oh went by themselves.

00:46:54.626 --> 00:46:56.386
Su Jeong was with them. The three of them went,

00:46:56.826 --> 00:46:58.796
and I followed them just to find that out?

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.026
No, that's not it.

00:47:02.026 --> 00:47:04.466
They totally ditched me. And it's not the first time.

Okay, fine, Eun Oh is one thing.

So I'm going to tell her officially.

00:48:44.566 --> 00:48:47.366
First, I wanted to say I'm sorry for dumping this on you.

00:48:48.336 --> 00:48:50.976
You're not dumping anything on me.

00:48:51.476 --> 00:48:54.876
I probably won't be able to do alumni volunteering either.

00:48:55.206 --> 00:48:58.046
I discussed it with Hyeon Su a while ago.

00:48:58.246 --> 00:49:00.916
Since no one else in the association wanted to be president.

00:49:02.386 --> 00:49:03.386
Is that so?

00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:07.286
But still, it's best you tell her in person.

00:49:07.726 --> 00:49:10.186
Since she's the biggest sponsor.

00:49:10.756 --> 00:49:13.156
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:16.066
So you're going into business together?

00:49:16.666 --> 00:49:17.666
Just the two of you?

00:49:18.496 --> 00:49:21.866
Yes. We get many turnkey requests.

00:49:25.206 --> 00:49:26.506
You two are something else.

00:49:26.806 --> 00:49:30.206
Also, I should have told you this sooner.

00:49:30.676 --> 00:49:32.876
- The cafe manager job... - Of course, you can't.

00:49:33.646 --> 00:49:37.386
Right. One or two projects a year was fine.

00:49:37.486 --> 00:49:40.156
You can't make a living on just 1 or 2 projects a year.

00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:42.026
You made the right call.

00:49:42.526 --> 00:49:46.456
You kids are grown up and starting a business together.

00:49:48.466 --> 00:49:51.866
I was only able to get into interior design thanks to you.

00:49:51.936 --> 00:49:52.936
That is true.

00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:56.206
And I was able to open my own office thanks to you.

00:49:56.266 --> 00:49:57.266
Darn right, you were.

00:49:58.576 --> 00:50:00.736
I've been very grateful for the office space.

00:50:01.946 --> 00:50:04.746
I'm planning to move to a new office.

00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:08.546
Okay. Mamdaerozip lives up to its name and is doing so well.

00:50:09.886 --> 00:50:11.886
- When? - Pretty soon.

00:50:19.356 --> 00:50:20.696
Thanks for everything, Ji Eun Oh.

00:50:24.836 --> 00:50:28.306
Working for Value of Hangyeol was rewarding, thanks to you.

00:50:29.306 --> 00:50:30.306
I had a great time,

00:50:31.336 --> 00:50:32.336
and I'm grateful.

00:50:33.576 --> 00:50:36.506
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:50:37.846 --> 00:50:39.446
I'm grateful to you as well.

00:50:39.816 --> 00:50:40.816
For everything.

00:50:56.496 --> 00:50:57.496
So...

00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:01.736
What have we decided to do about that thing?

00:51:02.006 --> 00:51:05.536
I think we need to answer the client for the Suri-dong house soon.

00:51:06.236 --> 00:51:07.306
I'm still considering it.

00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:10.746
Come on, Ms. Ji. You're so indecisive.

00:51:11.076 --> 00:51:14.346
You really need to think about it? Especially in front of your partner?

00:51:19.156 --> 00:51:22.826
Mr. Lee, don't jump to conclusions.

00:51:23.126 --> 00:51:26.526
I'm actually trying to figure out how to persuade the client.

00:51:26.626 --> 00:51:28.966
Brilliant as always.

00:51:29.266 --> 00:51:31.096
In that case, while you're at it,

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:35.836
your partner hopes you don't drop the quote too much.

00:51:43.576 --> 00:51:44.576
Figures.

00:51:48.786 --> 00:51:53.786
Ever since you two became partners, you enjoy bantering more and more.

00:51:54.726 --> 00:51:58.196
Yes. If I'm partners with him for just one year,

00:51:58.256 --> 00:51:59.926
I think I could make some serious money.

00:52:01.226 --> 00:52:04.066
- That's why you decided to do it. - What?

00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:07.336
You said it was for your family, that's why you partnered with him.

00:52:09.266 --> 00:52:11.176
You're right, I did.

00:52:11.936 --> 00:52:13.576
That's why I decided to do it.

00:52:14.136 --> 00:52:15.146
So I'd better make a lot of money.

00:52:29.356 --> 00:52:30.826
She's got her hands in everything.

00:52:37.596 --> 00:52:39.896
- Welcome. - I'm just looking. Thanks.

00:52:44.936 --> 00:52:47.576
No one can know we know each other. It's an absolute secret.

00:52:49.606 --> 00:52:50.806
Okay, you can stand up now.

00:52:53.276 --> 00:52:54.276
How do they feel?

00:52:55.116 --> 00:52:57.616
These are more comfortable than the other pair.

00:52:57.686 --> 00:52:58.686
I'll take these.

00:52:58.756 --> 00:53:00.586
Okay, I'll get you a new pair from the back.

00:53:02.986 --> 00:53:05.396
Where did you find this smart cookie?

00:53:06.926 --> 00:53:09.866
If I was going to impose on you, I couldn't bring a dimwit.

00:53:09.926 --> 00:53:11.495
As soon as she clocked in,

00:53:11.496 --> 00:53:13.366
she asked which were the bestsellers,

00:53:13.436 --> 00:53:16.936
took photos of every shoe, wrote down the model numbers,

00:53:17.306 --> 00:53:19.476
and noted all their features. She was actually memorizing them.

00:53:20.636 --> 00:53:21.646
Did she?

00:53:22.246 --> 00:53:25.216
Whenever it gets slow, she just keeps studying.

00:53:29.016 --> 00:53:30.286
Sorry for the wait.

00:53:31.756 --> 00:53:33.386
Let me just make sure this is a fresh pair.

00:53:34.786 --> 00:53:35.786
How do they look?

00:53:38.896 --> 00:53:42.796
She's sold 7 pairs today. And it's only her 1st day.

00:53:43.596 --> 00:53:45.996
- I'll get these ready for you. - Ms. Lee.

00:53:46.266 --> 00:53:48.106
Could you help this customer, please?

00:53:48.366 --> 00:53:49.366
Mr. Kang.

00:53:51.906 --> 00:53:52.976
One moment.

00:53:54.446 --> 00:53:55.676
Welcome!

00:53:56.046 --> 00:53:57.046
Hi.

00:53:57.506 --> 00:53:58.516
Hey!

00:53:59.016 --> 00:54:01.986
What are you doing here? You said we couldn't risk being seen.

00:54:02.586 --> 00:54:05.416
It's your first day. I was worried and came to check in.

00:54:05.486 --> 00:54:09.726
What's there to worry about? I've had many part-time jobs.

00:54:10.426 --> 00:54:11.426
You have?

00:54:12.596 --> 00:54:14.866
Hurry up and go. The assistant manager is watching.

00:54:15.026 --> 00:54:16.026
What?

00:54:16.496 --> 00:54:18.996
Then, please come back and see us again, sir.

00:54:20.836 --> 00:54:21.936
Wait, what?

00:54:29.906 --> 00:54:32.116
The quote is just so far over our budget.

00:54:32.576 --> 00:54:35.686
My kids are telling me to sell and move into an apartment.

00:54:36.186 --> 00:54:39.286
So, are you thinking of doing that as well, ma'am?

00:54:39.956 --> 00:54:40.956
No.

00:54:41.356 --> 00:54:44.086
I want to spend the rest of my days in this house.

00:54:46.056 --> 00:54:49.596
Then, ma'am, would it be okay if I paid a visit to your home?

00:54:50.096 --> 00:54:51.966
I wasn't the one who did the initial measurements,

00:54:52.036 --> 00:54:55.366
so I'd like to see the house myself and discuss some options.

00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:12.056
My husband was born in this house. I've lived here since we married,

00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:13.756
so I've grown very attached to it.

00:55:14.586 --> 00:55:15.826
I can imagine.

00:55:16.086 --> 00:55:20.296
Let me take a good look around, and I'll try to lower the estimate.

00:55:21.366 --> 00:55:23.326
Please, I'm counting on you, Ms. Ji.

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.196
Of course.

00:55:32.676 --> 00:55:34.976
Hey, Eun Oh. Speak of the devil. I was just about to call you.

00:55:35.106 --> 00:55:36.645
- What's up? - She's here.

00:55:36.646 --> 00:55:38.516
- Director Ko. - What?

00:55:44.086 --> 00:55:47.716
- Director Ko, what a surprise. - I know, sorry for dropping in.

00:55:49.286 --> 00:55:50.756
Why didn't you call me?

00:55:51.826 --> 00:55:53.296
I couldn't.

00:55:53.696 --> 00:55:56.796
I wasn't even sure if you'd be here,

00:55:56.966 --> 00:55:58.896
but I felt I had to come right away.

00:56:00.036 --> 00:56:01.436
Is something wrong?

00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:07.736
I did something I never do today. I took a nap.

00:56:08.646 --> 00:56:11.816
I only dozed off for a second, and I had a dream.

00:56:12.716 --> 00:56:14.076
What did you dream about?

00:56:14.646 --> 00:56:15.786
In the dream...

00:56:16.116 --> 00:56:19.656
You know that glass sculpture I gave you as a gift.

00:56:20.516 --> 00:56:23.486
It shattered. It was completely smashed to pieces.

00:56:25.026 --> 00:56:26.026
What?

00:56:26.626 --> 00:56:29.526
But it felt so real.

00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:32.436
It didn't just fall and break.

00:56:32.696 --> 00:56:35.136
It was crushed to pieces, as if something had stomped on it.

00:56:37.336 --> 00:56:39.676
So I just had to come see for myself.

00:56:42.276 --> 00:56:43.346
I see.

00:56:45.476 --> 00:56:47.576
Did something happen again?

00:56:48.516 --> 00:56:51.216
Or is that other problem still not resolved?

00:56:55.056 --> 00:56:58.326
My brother still hasn't come home.

00:57:02.266 --> 00:57:03.926
Get rid of it, Eun Oh.

00:57:04.496 --> 00:57:07.066
I don't think it was a very lucky gift.

00:57:07.536 --> 00:57:08.536
Instead...

00:57:10.136 --> 00:57:13.076
Take this. I bought it when I was in Paris.

00:57:13.176 --> 00:57:15.106
And I happened to buy an extra one, just in case.

00:57:15.546 --> 00:57:18.116
It was so beautiful, I figured I'd give it to someone.

00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:21.686
- No, I couldn't possibly. - No, I insist.

00:57:22.346 --> 00:57:23.846
Here, feel this.

00:57:24.186 --> 00:57:25.986
It's so soft and plush.

00:57:28.226 --> 00:57:29.826
I think what you need...

00:57:30.686 --> 00:57:32.256
is a little warmth.

00:57:39.466 --> 00:57:40.636
Please take care of yourself.

00:57:44.266 --> 00:57:45.276
Thank you.

00:57:54.276 --> 00:57:55.386
Oh, honey.

00:57:57.646 --> 00:57:58.786
What was that?

00:57:59.516 --> 00:58:04.456
Honey, you can't spring this on me. Why is this trip so last-minute?

00:58:04.956 --> 00:58:09.596
Our physicals are in two days. You skipped them last year too.

00:58:13.896 --> 00:58:15.136
Just a second.

00:58:16.566 --> 00:58:17.966
Yes, I'm listening.

00:58:20.436 --> 00:58:22.476
So, when will you be back?

00:58:24.146 --> 00:58:25.746
I wonder if I can reschedule.

00:58:30.886 --> 00:58:32.416
It's so hard to get an appointment.

00:58:33.116 --> 00:58:34.726
I wonder when I should reschedule for.

00:58:40.156 --> 00:58:41.156
Who's that?

00:58:43.366 --> 00:58:44.696
She looks familiar.

00:58:51.576 --> 00:58:52.976
Oh, where are my manners?

00:58:53.606 --> 00:58:55.046
That must have been awkward for you.

00:58:55.506 --> 00:58:56.506
Not at all.

00:58:57.906 --> 00:58:59.416
That could work.

00:58:59.946 --> 00:59:04.316
You heard, right? My husband and I have physicals in three days,

00:59:04.386 --> 00:59:06.756
but he's going to Germany on a business trip.

00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:08.526
Yes.

00:59:09.126 --> 00:59:10.826
Come with me, Ms. Ji.

00:59:11.926 --> 00:59:14.126
I hate hospitals as it is.

00:59:14.526 --> 00:59:17.596
I especially can't stand those all-day checkups,

00:59:17.866 --> 00:59:19.836
and my husband usually has to drag me there.

00:59:20.466 --> 00:59:23.036
And the appointment is already paid for.

00:59:24.106 --> 00:59:25.436
You should take his spot.

00:59:27.336 --> 00:59:28.576
Oh, no. I couldn't.

00:59:29.146 --> 00:59:31.416
When was the last time you had a proper physical?

00:59:33.016 --> 00:59:34.316
Back when I was with my old company.

00:59:35.186 --> 00:59:36.816
Then you're long overdue.

00:59:38.156 --> 00:59:40.716
You'd just be keeping me company,

00:59:41.386 --> 00:59:43.256
so won't you please come with me?

00:59:50.796 --> 00:59:52.036
Hey, is that what you were talking about?

00:59:52.696 --> 00:59:54.196
No way. I've got goosebumps.

00:59:55.406 --> 00:59:57.506
Wait, she didn't even know it broke.

00:59:57.566 --> 00:59:59.136
How could she have a dream like that?

00:59:59.936 --> 01:00:02.806
Especially with Gang Oh stressing you out so much lately.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:05.476
Tell me about it.

01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:09.086
It's like she knows exactly what I'm feeling.

01:00:10.186 --> 01:00:11.216
It's so surreal.

01:00:22.496 --> 01:00:23.496
Mom.

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:25.796
Mom, don't you think you should be going to the hospital?

01:00:26.296 --> 01:00:27.296
No.

01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:32.436
No, I'm fine, really. Don't worry. Just get ready.

01:00:35.246 --> 01:00:37.576
Mom, I think you have a fever.

01:00:38.246 --> 01:00:41.686
I'm fine. Now, hurry up and go.

01:00:42.816 --> 01:00:45.185
You haven't had a drop of water since last night.

01:00:45.186 --> 01:00:47.516
How can you take me anywhere?

01:00:50.186 --> 01:00:53.296
Just go and get your checkup done.

01:00:54.096 --> 01:00:56.266
And for that lady...

01:00:56.896 --> 01:01:00.136
Tell her that I'm very grateful.

01:01:00.696 --> 01:01:01.706
Okay?

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:35.436
- Ms. Ji. - Hello.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.146
You skipped one dinner, and it shows.

01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:45.976
It's because you're too thin.

01:01:46.246 --> 01:01:48.846
After our checkups, I'll take you to a great restaurant I know.

01:01:49.486 --> 01:01:51.586
Okay. Oh, right!

01:01:51.656 --> 01:01:54.256
My mom insisted I thank you.

01:01:55.056 --> 01:01:57.686
I actually haven't been feeling my best lately,

01:01:57.886 --> 01:02:00.326
so she's grateful for letting me get such a thorough physical.

01:02:01.866 --> 01:02:03.666
I guess you and your mom talk about everything.

01:02:04.966 --> 01:02:06.236
Not everything.

01:02:08.566 --> 01:02:09.566
I'm jealous.

01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:34.096
Oh, are you done already?

01:02:37.996 --> 01:02:39.036
Shall we go?

01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:40.866
Yes.

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:46.266
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:46.596 --> 01:03:51.136
A businessman, dressing like that? And you have it all figured out?

01:03:51.236 --> 01:03:53.406
Getting left at the altar?

01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:55.605
- Don't you tell Sang Cheol, dear. - Mother.

01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:58.046
I'll run away from home if you do.

01:03:58.106 --> 01:04:03.046
Knowing all the facts on paper, does that mean you truly know them?

01:04:03.186 --> 01:04:04.816
You only know me on the surface.

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:07.516
On days you go home after 10pm, I'll be the one to take you.

01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:10.786
Is Seong Jae making a move? Is he done playing Daddy Long Legs?

01:04:10.886 --> 01:04:14.326
No man spends time on a woman he isn't interested in.

01:04:14.696 --> 01:04:18.396
There are two kinds of love. The kind you realise first.

01:04:18.496 --> 01:04:20.136
And the kind others notice before you do.
