00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:45.074
(Orthopedics Clinic 1)
My arm

00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:46.154
is completely healed.

00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:48.555
It's even more flexible than before.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:49.755
- Look.
- Enough.

00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:51.074
Be careful

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.635
not to lift anything heavy
for three months.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.714
- Got it.
- Or you'll risk habitual dislocation.

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:56.995
- Okay.
- Yiming.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:58.354
Let's go for food.

00:01:58.675 --> 00:01:59.635
Okay, go ahead.

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:06.154
It's already mealtime.

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:08.034
- Will you...?
- Okay, let's eat.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:10.995
I heard your canteen

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:11.914
has great food.

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:13.275
Alright, let's go.

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.034
Wenjin, over here.

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:22.474
Come sit with us.

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:24.275
Come on.

00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:27.275
You don't know her, right?

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:28.675
- Alright.
- Thanks.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:29.754
Let me introduce you.

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:32.675
Yu Yiming, your senior.

00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:35.474
An orthopedic PhD two years above you.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:37.555
- Hello, senior.
- Hi.

00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:39.275
Xu Wenjin, your junior.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:40.714
Neurosurgery PhD.

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:42.795
Top scorer in Shandong.

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:45.515
Impressive. Nice to meet you.

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:46.634
Me too.

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:50.555
Guo, stop bringing up ancient history.

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:52.275
Don't be modest.

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:53.355
Right after

00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:54.714
her graduation,

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:57.835
Wenjin got invited by
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

00:02:57.955 --> 00:02:59.795
to a three-year cancer research project.

00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:00.835
I'm so jealous.

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.594
Dig in. Should I get you some soup?

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:06.795
No need, this is enough.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.600
Which department are you from?

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:09.874
I'm not staff here.

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:12.075
She's my high school classmate Qiao Lin.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.355
She happened to

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:14.594
get my appointment

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.952
- by chance.
- What a coincidence.

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:17.634
What do you do?

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.555
I sell cosmetics at a mall.

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:22.995
She just came to Jingzhou alone.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.395
She's gaining experience

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:25.555
for her career.

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:28.874
I like makeup, too.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.034
But I think

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.555
makeup requires skill just like surgery.

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:33.955
Every morning, I try

00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:35.154
to learn from tutorial videos,

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:36.176
but I never get it right.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:40.075
Why don't you visit my store?

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.914
- I can do your makeup.
- Sounds great.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.034
I'll customize makeup based on

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:46.115
your skin type and tone,

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:48.034
and your facial features.

00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:50.034
Let me add you on WeChat.

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:51.474
Come find me at the store.

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:52.235
Alright.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:55.634
- Shall we do the same?
- Sure.

00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:56.154
Okay.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:57.115
I'll add you.

00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:57.594
Alright.

00:03:58.075 --> 00:03:59.795
Senior, let me add you too.

00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:00.555
Okay.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.474
Qiao Lin.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:03.874
I sent the request.

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:05.434
Okay.

00:04:06.194 --> 00:04:06.634
Thanks.

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:09.194
Dig in.

00:04:09.355 --> 00:04:09.795
Alright.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.760
(Conan)

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:45.675
Do you want to watch TV

00:05:45.754 --> 00:05:46.995
or play games?

00:05:47.235 --> 00:05:47.995
Play games.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:49.274
Alright,

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.035
but only thirty minutes.

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:53.074
- Deal?
- Deal.

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:54.194
Okay.

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:58.394
Let me show you something first.

00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:00.235
Look.

00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:04.555
See?

00:06:07.874 --> 00:06:09.274
You took these?

00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.754
(Junlong Equestrian)

00:06:13.754 --> 00:06:14.995
You look really cool

00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:16.274
when riding,

00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:18.715
especially when you jump obstacles.

00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:22.115
You look almost like Hua Tian.

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:24.274
You know Hua Tian?

00:06:24.475 --> 00:06:25.475
Of course, I do.

00:06:25.874 --> 00:06:28.675
He's your favorite equestrian athlete.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.035
He won

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:33.115
the individual champion in show jumping

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:34.274
and the team champion

00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:35.715
in the event.

00:06:37.274 --> 00:06:37.954
Listen.

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:39.314
You can ask the coach

00:06:39.314 --> 00:06:40.155
to record videos

00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:41.874
during your future training.

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:42.834
Then, you'll know

00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:43.834
your weaknesses

00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:45.795
and exactly what to work on.

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:51.035
Look carefully.

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.074
Then you can play games.

00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:54.795
I'll keep taking photos.

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:55.394
Okay.

00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:00.434
Look at this move.

00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:02.355
Cool, huh?

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:03.475
Check out the horse.

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:05.595
What about the horse?

00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.536
(Hospital)

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:16.754
How is he?

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:19.754
He fell asleep after the IV.

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:32.555
Are you working?

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:36.834
I need to tell you something

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:37.634
important.

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:40.514
I didn't want to worry

00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:41.675
your parents.

00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:46.736
But Haochen

00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:51.155
fell from the horse on purpose.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:53.235
What do you mean?

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:08.634
Why would he do that?

00:08:09.475 --> 00:08:10.434
I think

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:13.555
he was trying to seek attention

00:08:14.954 --> 00:08:16.715
from his family.

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:20.274
I've been observing Haochen.

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:21.715
Whenever he's with

00:08:21.754 --> 00:08:22.954
you or your parents,

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:25.475
he's extremely happy.

00:08:26.434 --> 00:08:27.434
But when you're gone,

00:08:27.434 --> 00:08:28.915
he gets very upset.

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:35.914
But he shouldn't hurt himself.

00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:37.874
How would a child know

00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:39.554
the right way to cope?

00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:45.115
I have a friend.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.475
She told me that

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:54.235
due to family hardships,

00:08:55.554 --> 00:08:57.034
she was sent away

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:58.835
for foster care

00:08:58.835 --> 00:09:00.075
when she was young.

00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:02.914
Though they brought her home later,

00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:07.274
she still struggled to get

00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:10.674
the love and companionship she needed.

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:18.274
What's wrong?

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:21.754
Dad, Mom.

00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:22.715
What?

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:23.394
Come here.

00:09:23.634 --> 00:09:24.195
My hand.

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:25.914
You're hurt?

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:26.914
Get a Band-Aid.

00:09:26.995 --> 00:09:27.634
Band-Aid.

00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:29.195
Come on.

00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:30.274
Right here.

00:09:30.274 --> 00:09:30.794
Put it on.

00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:32.874
Careful.

00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:34.235
Careful.

00:09:34.394 --> 00:09:35.715
Any other injuries?

00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:36.955
Anywhere else?

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:38.075
Do your legs hurt?

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:39.195
Easy now.

00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:39.835
Sweetheart.

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:40.914
Take it slow.

00:09:46.754 --> 00:09:47.955
They say

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:51.394
a happy childhood

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:53.595
can heal you for a lifetime.

00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:57.075
But an unhappy one

00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:01.595
takes a lifetime to heal.

00:10:08.435 --> 00:10:09.514
That's why I believe

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:12.355
no material comforts

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:15.955
can replace family love and presence.

00:10:17.154 --> 00:10:17.754
Right?

00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:23.554
Haochen's too young.

00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:26.754
Can't we ask

00:10:27.034 --> 00:10:28.514
your parents to reconsider

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:30.715
sending him abroad?

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:35.315
Okay, let's do as you say.

00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:39.514
Thank you for caring for him.

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.355
I'll go to the office early tomorrow

00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:43.674
and get the work done.

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:46.674
Let's spend more time with him.

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:51.435
Alright.

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:53.514
Stay here with Haochen.

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.355
I'll fetch some clothes.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:56.754
Okay, go ahead.

00:10:58.315 --> 00:10:59.274
I'll head back now.

00:11:00.274 --> 00:11:00.794
Bye.

00:11:18.674 --> 00:11:20.514
Qiao Lin, you're up next.

00:11:20.874 --> 00:11:21.274
Alright.

00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:23.115
Your sales performance is good.

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:26.914
You achieved
the top regional ranking so soon.

00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.955
It's remarkable.

00:11:29.634 --> 00:11:31.154
Plus, the neo-Chinese-style makeup

00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:32.195
you did for clients

00:11:32.394 --> 00:11:33.514
went viral online

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:35.794
with great reviews.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.034
It benefits our brand image.

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:40.435
We're promoting a salesperson

00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:42.715
from the store to the headquarters'

00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:43.955
sales team.

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:45.674
You're on the shortlist.

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:49.674
Thank you for the recognition.

00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:52.034
I genuinely love this industry,

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:53.235
especially when

00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:54.955
the customers like the makeup I've done.

00:11:55.034 --> 00:11:56.034
Their happiness

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.835
makes me happy too.

00:11:58.715 --> 00:12:00.794
Who do you think
should get the last spot?

00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:02.955
Qiao Lin might be alright.

00:12:03.914 --> 00:12:04.794
Qiao Lin.

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:06.315
That girl's decent.

00:12:06.914 --> 00:12:08.514
But her education level is too low.

00:12:09.514 --> 00:12:10.394
What a shame.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.355
Let's stick to the standards.

00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:13.154
Alright.

00:12:16.715 --> 00:12:17.554
Education level.

00:12:20.483 --> 00:12:23.120
(Interview result: Failed)

00:12:25.955 --> 00:12:28.835
What's wrong? Did you get eliminated?

00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:32.154
You know what?

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:33.235
This industry keeps

00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:34.634
getting more competitive.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.355
My cousin graduated

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.514
from a world-renowned university,

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:40.754
but started as a sales associate.

00:12:40.914 --> 00:12:42.034
So forget about it.

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:55.634
You've already ordered?

00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:56.315
Well,

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:57.715
I invited you for food,

00:12:57.715 --> 00:12:58.514
but I'm late.

00:12:58.794 --> 00:12:59.674
Sorry.

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:00.394
No worries.

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:01.195
Let's eat.

00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:01.914
Okay.

00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:04.075
You bought a new laptop?

00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:07.634
It's for work?

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:09.274
The trends are changing

00:13:09.274 --> 00:13:10.154
way too fast.

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:12.355
I bought it to study

00:13:13.034 --> 00:13:13.835
and gather

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:14.955
information on

00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:16.034
the latest makeup styles.

00:13:17.794 --> 00:13:19.754
Plus, I want to continue my education.

00:13:20.394 --> 00:13:22.034
I want to enroll in adult education

00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.355
to improve my qualifications.

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:26.115
Sounds great.

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:27.475
I fully

00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:28.355
support you.

00:13:29.034 --> 00:13:30.394
Don't rush to say that.

00:13:31.075 --> 00:13:32.034
I'm just having

00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:32.874
this idea.

00:13:33.115 --> 00:13:35.034
But I haven't decided on a major

00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:36.034
or anything.

00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:37.034
That's why I wanted

00:13:37.034 --> 00:13:38.115
to talk with you.

00:13:38.674 --> 00:13:39.195
Alright,

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.075
tell me.

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:42.595
What's on your mind?

00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.034
Well, currently,

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.595
I'm just doing sales.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.075
A relevant major

00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:49.034
would be marketing.

00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:50.754
I want to join adult education.

00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:52.634
It's not so easy to graduate

00:13:53.794 --> 00:13:55.235
from those programs.

00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:56.955
So I was thinking,

00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:59.274
even if I choose a major I like,

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:01.034
the courses I'm weak in

00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:02.195
could still become

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:03.195
obstacles, right?

00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:04.634
That's why I thought

00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:05.674
that maybe

00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:07.794
you could tutor me in math

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:08.794
and help me catch up.

00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:11.514
Please don't say no.

00:14:11.514 --> 00:14:12.475
Please please.

00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:14.274
No one else will help me but you.

00:14:15.634 --> 00:14:17.355
I'm begging you.

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:18.274
I'm begging you.

00:14:21.634 --> 00:14:22.674
- Please.
- Alright.

00:14:22.914 --> 00:14:23.955
But I might not

00:14:24.835 --> 00:14:25.794
be a good teacher.

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:26.914
You'll be the best.

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:27.874
Mr. Yu, cheers.

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.424
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

00:14:38.034 --> 00:14:39.274
Have some breakfast.

00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:41.195
Your brother will come

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:42.914
after the meeting.

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:44.154
He promised.

00:14:45.075 --> 00:14:46.835
And he visited last night.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.634
He bought you this. You like it, huh?

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.235
Play later.

00:14:56.034 --> 00:14:57.394
Thank you, sis-in-law.

00:14:58.634 --> 00:14:59.634
You're welcome.

00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:15.835
Did...

00:15:18.514 --> 00:15:19.435
Did you just

00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:22.554
call me "sis-in-law"?

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:27.394
Sis-in-law.

00:15:29.674 --> 00:15:30.394
Well,

00:15:30.754 --> 00:15:32.195
I was rude yesterday.

00:15:33.235 --> 00:15:34.075
Sorry about that.

00:15:42.794 --> 00:15:44.554
Good kid for admitting mistakes.

00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:46.355
You're forgiven.

00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:47.754
Sis-in-law forgives you.

00:15:54.794 --> 00:15:55.595
Want some soy milk?

00:15:58.674 --> 00:15:59.394
I-I'll do it.

00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:03.874
Wipe it.

00:16:05.914 --> 00:16:06.514
Hands.

00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:14.914
Sis-in-law.

00:16:16.634 --> 00:16:19.634
You said you could
keep me from going abroad.

00:16:20.034 --> 00:16:20.955
Is that true?

00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:23.554
Of course, it's true.

00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:24.674
Would I lie to you?

00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:27.274
But you must listen to me.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:29.235
Okay.

00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:31.475
Have an egg.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:36.715
What's wrong?

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:41.674
Here.

00:16:56.075 --> 00:16:57.394
I've brought you the iPad.

00:16:57.794 --> 00:16:59.355
And I renewed your membership.

00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:01.674
Let's go.

00:17:02.514 --> 00:17:03.274
Rest your eyes.

00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:04.834
Protect your eyesight.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.915
Call me if you need anything.

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:08.314
Yeah, we're leaving.

00:17:08.314 --> 00:17:09.514
- Dad...
- Yan, take care of him.

00:17:09.514 --> 00:17:10.554
- Dad...
- Call us.

00:17:10.554 --> 00:17:11.715
Mom, Dad.

00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:13.875
Wait a minute.

00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:21.354
What's wrong? Do you need something?

00:17:22.754 --> 00:17:25.235
Can you stay with Haochen today?

00:17:25.354 --> 00:17:26.195
We have meetings.

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:28.834
But Haochen is getting

00:17:28.834 --> 00:17:30.235
even more upset.

00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:31.475
We must take it seriously.

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:32.955
Yeah, I've noticed.

00:17:33.034 --> 00:17:34.475
We're making time to visit him.

00:17:34.715 --> 00:17:36.554
We brought his iPad, but that kid barely

00:17:36.554 --> 00:17:37.155
speaks to us.

00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:38.074
Kids are rebellious

00:17:38.074 --> 00:17:39.475
- during puberty.
- Yeah.

00:17:41.114 --> 00:17:41.794
Take a look

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:42.754
at Haochen's drawing.

00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:47.514
- What's this?
- My Mom and Dad.

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:48.754
(My Mom and Dad)
Well done.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.435
Our heads are smartphones.

00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:53.235
Our child has remarkable creativity.

00:17:53.354 --> 00:17:55.475
I'd give him five stars
if I were his art teacher.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.754
This is what Haochen thinks of you.

00:17:58.074 --> 00:18:00.114
This is Haochen

00:18:00.114 --> 00:18:01.114
when he's alone.

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:02.834
Is this healthy?

00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:08.915
He has always lacked companionship.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.875
The person who spent
the most time with him

00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:12.915
was the nanny.

00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:16.915
You're busy. Haoming's busy.

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:18.915
You spent more time

00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:20.915
on your phones than with Haochen.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.834
He does have many years ahead of him.

00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:26.715
But childhood is short.

00:18:27.635 --> 00:18:28.594
Haochen doesn't really

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.554
want his iPad or smartphone.

00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:32.554
He wants what's most precious

00:18:32.554 --> 00:18:33.594
to you.

00:18:34.754 --> 00:18:35.554
Your time.

00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:48.554
So I'm asking you to stay

00:18:50.314 --> 00:18:53.195
and keep him company

00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:56.435
for just one day.

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:03.754
Mom, Dad, Haochen, food is ready.

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:04.875
Go ahead.

00:19:05.554 --> 00:19:06.354
Yeah, go ahead.

00:19:06.435 --> 00:19:07.554
We're watching the match.

00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:10.794
A pity, huh?

00:19:12.114 --> 00:19:13.034
One question for you.

00:19:14.435 --> 00:19:16.155
Why did I make you learn equestrian?

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:21.155
You know what?

00:19:22.114 --> 00:19:23.955
I've chosen an excellent school for you.

00:19:24.314 --> 00:19:26.475
This school offers eleven sports.

00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:28.395
Equestrian ranks first.

00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.435
Equestrian is a graceful sport.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.104
If you master equestrian skills

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.475
before entering this school,

00:19:33.475 --> 00:19:35.114
you've already gained an advantage.

00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:38.155
Have it.

00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:45.715
Thank you.

00:20:22.675 --> 00:20:24.395
I won't drive you back today.

00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:26.514
Okay.

00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:30.155
It's red, your favorite.

00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:31.435
It's for you.

00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:33.354
Why?

00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:35.594
To congratulate you.

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:39.514
Your financial news broadcasts
have been so well-received this week.

00:20:40.314 --> 00:20:41.554
Given your current status,

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.675
having a car makes a statement.

00:20:44.195 --> 00:20:44.915
Also,

00:20:45.715 --> 00:20:47.114
Haochen has been spoiled

00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:48.875
ever since he was born.

00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:50.114
His temper

00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:51.195
grew worse and worse.

00:20:51.554 --> 00:20:53.195
Even the formidable Ms. Yu

00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:54.395
couldn't handle him.

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:56.235
I never expected

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:58.675
you'd get along so well with him.

00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:00.594
I can sense that

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.314
he genuinely likes you.

00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:04.155
And he got badly injured.

00:21:04.794 --> 00:21:06.114
He's been discharged early

00:21:06.554 --> 00:21:07.754
thanks to you.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.314
Haochen is your brother.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.675
We're family.

00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:13.314
It's only natural for us

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.675
to care for each other.

00:21:14.754 --> 00:21:16.034
You don't have to buy me gifts

00:21:16.034 --> 00:21:17.594
whenever I do something.

00:21:17.594 --> 00:21:18.794
You've done a great job.

00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:21.114
You deserve a reward.

00:21:21.955 --> 00:21:23.554
Because I appreciate it.

00:21:24.594 --> 00:21:25.915
You're a typical boss.

00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:27.675
Your expression of emotions

00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:28.794
has become transactional.

00:21:29.715 --> 00:21:30.754
I just want to give you

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:32.514
the life you want.

00:21:34.514 --> 00:21:36.235
You are all I want.

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.314
See you.

00:21:59.794 --> 00:22:00.435
(Zhou Zeyuan)
(Let's meet.)

00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:10.314
These are my company's

00:22:10.314 --> 00:22:11.514
financial reports.

00:22:12.794 --> 00:22:14.754
Here are the ongoing

00:22:14.754 --> 00:22:15.514
(Projects)
R&D Projects.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.435
Here's the project proposal.

00:22:19.195 --> 00:22:19.834
All here.

00:22:32.754 --> 00:22:33.594
I came to tell you

00:22:33.594 --> 00:22:34.715
that your collaboration

00:22:36.675 --> 00:22:37.915
with my husband

00:22:37.955 --> 00:22:38.915
won't happen.

00:22:43.354 --> 00:22:43.995
Why not?

00:22:44.274 --> 00:22:45.435
I work in journalism

00:22:45.794 --> 00:22:47.395
and conduct investigations.

00:22:47.955 --> 00:22:49.074
All your employees here

00:22:49.114 --> 00:22:50.395
are hired actors.

00:22:51.794 --> 00:22:54.034
This whole company is just a front

00:22:54.995 --> 00:22:57.395
to scam money from investors.

00:22:58.034 --> 00:22:59.034
So I'm sure

00:22:59.915 --> 00:23:01.995
you don't have any real operations.

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.715
I'm not surprised

00:23:08.715 --> 00:23:11.955
you saw through this.
You know better about

00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:13.314
hiring actors.

00:23:20.195 --> 00:23:20.955
What do you mean?

00:23:21.395 --> 00:23:23.955
Your parents aren't actually abroad.

00:23:24.314 --> 00:23:25.955
They live in a small town.

00:23:27.074 --> 00:23:27.955
When they came

00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:29.155
to visit you in Jingzhou,

00:23:29.155 --> 00:23:30.195
you treated them coldly.

00:23:30.235 --> 00:23:31.195
They left quickly.

00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:33.594
I met them briefly then.

00:23:33.794 --> 00:23:34.875
I don't have many strengths

00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:36.274
except a good memory.

00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:40.715
Don't bother forming

00:23:40.715 --> 00:23:41.594
a strategy.

00:23:41.834 --> 00:23:43.114
I never intended

00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:44.114
to destroy

00:23:44.114 --> 00:23:45.794
what you've achieved.

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:47.554
My company needs funding.

00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:48.915
You married into wealth.

00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:49.834
Helping me

00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:52.114
would be effortless for you.

00:24:04.034 --> 00:24:04.635
Zeyuan,

00:24:05.554 --> 00:24:06.514
I still remember

00:24:06.834 --> 00:24:07.875
that you told me

00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:09.834
to be honest on resumes

00:24:11.195 --> 00:24:11.875
and that I must

00:24:12.794 --> 00:24:13.955
walk in the light.

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:18.395
So I don't understand

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:20.314
why you've become

00:24:20.314 --> 00:24:21.314
like this now.

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:23.594
Then why did you hide

00:24:23.594 --> 00:24:25.034
your family background?

00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:27.034
Why would you

00:24:27.034 --> 00:24:28.195
hide your real parents

00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:29.274
in the dark?

00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:30.435
I saw your wedding photo

00:24:30.514 --> 00:24:31.635
at Ms. Ma's place.

00:24:31.675 --> 00:24:33.034
Those fake parents of yours

00:24:34.114 --> 00:24:35.995
do look like educated elites.

00:24:36.354 --> 00:24:37.195
But I get it.

00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:39.514
Without these glamorous facades,

00:24:39.514 --> 00:24:41.195
every step we take would be harder.

00:24:41.715 --> 00:24:42.635
We've both struggled.

00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:44.715
I bet you know this.

00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:45.675
No matter how hard

00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:46.834
you try, some things

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:47.675
don't change.

00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:49.514
Those of us who come from nothing

00:24:49.514 --> 00:24:50.754
need to dress ourselves

00:24:50.754 --> 00:24:51.675
in noble disguises.

00:24:58.195 --> 00:24:59.514
Since we're the same,

00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:02.235
let's help each other.

00:25:27.114 --> 00:25:27.635
Yan.

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:32.034
You're finally back.

00:25:32.314 --> 00:25:33.074
What's wrong, Mom?

00:25:33.314 --> 00:25:35.314
Haochen's birthday is early next month.

00:25:35.314 --> 00:25:36.875
How should we celebrate it?

00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:39.155
You can decide.

00:25:39.554 --> 00:25:41.395
I asked him, but he wouldn't talk.

00:25:41.475 --> 00:25:42.754
I can't handle this kid.

00:25:42.955 --> 00:25:45.235
He likes you. He'll like
whatever you do for him.

00:25:48.114 --> 00:25:48.794
Let me think.

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.715
Ms. Ma is bringing a friend tomorrow.

00:25:53.034 --> 00:25:53.995
She's so picky.

00:25:54.034 --> 00:25:54.875
I have no idea

00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:56.435
what to cook for her.

00:25:56.834 --> 00:25:57.435
Help me.

00:25:59.594 --> 00:26:01.155
Ms. Ma likes shrimp.

00:26:01.475 --> 00:26:02.754
Maybe I'll make her

00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:04.314
shrimp with black truffle oil.

00:26:04.955 --> 00:26:05.514
- How's that?
- Perfect.

00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:06.875
And she's dieting.

00:26:07.395 --> 00:26:08.875
I'll keep the dishes low-calorie.

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:09.514
Rest assured.

00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:11.435
I know I can count on you.

00:26:12.514 --> 00:26:14.354
Hui said she needs you in the kitchen.

00:26:15.235 --> 00:26:16.514
- I'll go then.
- Go ahead.

00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:23.435
- What's wrong, Hui?
- Yan.

00:26:23.995 --> 00:26:25.955
How should I cook these tonight?

00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:29.395
Steam the rainbow trout.

00:26:29.514 --> 00:26:30.754
Haochen has been coughing.

00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:32.875
Skip the seafood. It's inflammatory.

00:26:32.955 --> 00:26:34.875
Replace them with vegetarian dishes.

00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:35.635
Okay.

00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:38.594
Did the fruits I ordered arrive?

00:26:39.114 --> 00:26:40.554
I washed and refrigerated them.

00:26:40.594 --> 00:26:42.074
Alright, I'm heading back then.

00:26:42.235 --> 00:26:42.834
Yan.

00:26:45.074 --> 00:26:46.594
I may need a day off tomorrow

00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.235
for personal matters.

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:51.875
But Ms. Yu needs help
hosting guests tomorrow.

00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:53.114
Go ahead. I'll handle it.

00:26:54.195 --> 00:26:54.754
Really?

00:26:55.995 --> 00:26:57.794
With you here, I'm completely at ease.

00:26:58.074 --> 00:27:00.195
They all love your cooking.

00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:03.395
Only because you help me.

00:27:05.915 --> 00:27:06.554
Yan.

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:08.955
You seem

00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:10.274
different from before.

00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:13.754
How so?

00:27:15.034 --> 00:27:15.955
Now, you look

00:27:16.195 --> 00:27:17.754
like the lady of the house.

00:27:19.363 --> 00:27:24.314
♪I was lost in the dark,
and it's too hurt to even see♪

00:27:24.314 --> 00:27:25.155
I'm leaving.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.061
♪See the world and how it flows.
We never let go♪

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:32.794
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

00:27:32.794 --> 00:27:34.594
You want to take on patient No. 38's

00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:36.195
spine correction surgery?

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:37.074
Yes, sir.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.235
Type 1 neurofibromatosis with scoliosis.

00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:42.715
This surgery requires extreme precision.

00:27:43.155 --> 00:27:46.435
Any mistake could cause
lifelong paralysis.

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.475
And the patient's young.

00:27:48.915 --> 00:27:49.834
It's very challenging.

00:27:50.195 --> 00:27:50.995
I understand.

00:27:51.554 --> 00:27:52.514
My plan is to conduct

00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:54.435
multiple staged surgeries

00:27:55.034 --> 00:27:56.754
to minimize risks.

00:27:57.155 --> 00:27:57.675
Of course,

00:27:58.114 --> 00:27:58.995
we'll monitor

00:27:58.995 --> 00:28:01.235
the patient's tolerance responses

00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:02.475
during the operation.

00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:04.155
Of course, I know

00:28:04.235 --> 00:28:05.314
the family has concerns.

00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:07.834
We'll handle
pre-op communication carefully.

00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:08.354
Okay.

00:28:09.074 --> 00:28:10.235
Your suggestions are noted.

00:28:10.995 --> 00:28:14.195
I'll discuss with the higher-ups.

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:15.915
Alright.

00:28:18.475 --> 00:28:19.314
Thank you, sir.

00:28:31.155 --> 00:28:32.354
This is a bit spicy.

00:28:32.514 --> 00:28:33.395
Not at all.

00:28:33.435 --> 00:28:34.395
It's amazing.

00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:35.195
Skewers.

00:28:35.635 --> 00:28:37.114
Have it while it's hot.

00:28:37.235 --> 00:28:38.715
Super crispy. That's why we came.

00:28:38.715 --> 00:28:39.074
Okay.

00:28:39.395 --> 00:28:40.514
Smells great.

00:28:42.314 --> 00:28:42.995
What's her deal?

00:28:50.114 --> 00:28:50.955
What's wrong?

00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:53.034
Why are you silent?

00:28:53.314 --> 00:28:54.834
You ordered this. Won't you eat?

00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:56.074
This is good.

00:28:58.395 --> 00:29:00.114
Dig in. Don't just watch me.

00:29:00.354 --> 00:29:01.834
I shouldn't. I'm on a diet.

00:29:02.114 --> 00:29:03.114
That's too much.

00:29:04.274 --> 00:29:05.955
I'll gain 500 grams tomorrow.

00:29:06.915 --> 00:29:08.314
Dig in. I'll be right back.

00:29:11.915 --> 00:29:12.594
Yu Yiming.

00:29:13.594 --> 00:29:14.475
You're alone?

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:15.875
Why are you here?

00:29:16.395 --> 00:29:17.155
I came with my...

00:29:19.114 --> 00:29:21.475
I'm just getting some skewers to go.

00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:25.155
I...

00:29:26.395 --> 00:29:27.715
I've never seen you drink.

00:29:28.514 --> 00:29:29.995
I avoided drinking because of work.

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:32.915
Fine. Let me join you.
Waiter. A dozen beers.

00:29:33.955 --> 00:29:35.314
Mind your head. Oh my.

00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:44.635
Here.

00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:47.514
Have some water.

00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:47.314
Well...

00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:49.354
I bought you breakfast.

00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:01.395
I overdrank because I was

00:31:02.074 --> 00:31:03.554
overwhelmed with the surgery.

00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:07.314
I do remember what happened

00:31:08.514 --> 00:31:09.395
afterward.

00:31:17.514 --> 00:31:19.475
You should have told me.

00:31:19.794 --> 00:31:20.514
Forget about it.

00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:23.754
N-Nothing happened.

00:31:24.314 --> 00:31:24.834
Right?

00:31:25.715 --> 00:31:27.074
You're pretty heavy, by the way.

00:31:27.074 --> 00:31:28.554
Carrying you was exhausting.

00:31:28.995 --> 00:31:30.514
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:32.594
It won't happen again.

00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:33.675
It's fine. It can happen.

00:31:36.114 --> 00:31:36.955
No, no.

00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:38.834
That's not what I meant.

00:31:39.395 --> 00:31:41.114
You're under too much stress.

00:31:41.114 --> 00:31:42.354
Letting loose occasionally

00:31:42.354 --> 00:31:43.915
is actually good for you.

00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:48.195
This is good.

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:48.995
Yeah.

00:31:49.328 --> 00:31:50.896
Have you spoken to your sister lately?

00:31:51.514 --> 00:31:52.114
No.

00:31:52.834 --> 00:31:54.155
She's happy that you're attending

00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:55.114
adult college.

00:31:58.155 --> 00:32:01.074
You've been updating her about me?

00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:03.875
She asked me to look after you.

00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:06.955
She could've told me herself.

00:32:09.195 --> 00:32:10.995
You're quite similar.

00:32:11.514 --> 00:32:12.235
Both stubborn.

00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:14.314
You care about each other,

00:32:14.955 --> 00:32:16.715
but can't sit down for a proper talk.

00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:22.395
I wish you could open up
to each other someday,

00:32:22.715 --> 00:32:23.888
without a messenger like me.

00:32:26.114 --> 00:32:27.195
It doesn't matter.

00:32:29.834 --> 00:32:30.514
Spin.

00:32:30.514 --> 00:32:31.314
Hide.

00:32:31.475 --> 00:32:32.114
Run.

00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:33.915
Can't find it.

00:32:33.915 --> 00:32:34.435
Nice.

00:32:34.594 --> 00:32:35.875
You ruined my dress.

00:32:36.274 --> 00:32:37.074
Bu. Sweetie.

00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:37.475
Fetch.

00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:39.435
Where is it?

00:32:40.114 --> 00:32:41.955
Ms. Yu is really nice.

00:32:43.794 --> 00:32:44.475
Well done.

00:32:45.514 --> 00:32:46.114
Come here.

00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:47.155
Ms. Yu.

00:32:48.514 --> 00:32:49.155
Tianzi.

00:32:49.354 --> 00:32:50.314
What took you so long?

00:32:52.715 --> 00:32:53.875
We've been waiting forever.

00:32:54.314 --> 00:32:55.240
I'm slow getting ready.

00:32:55.354 --> 00:32:57.314
Ms. Yu, meet my friend.

00:32:57.915 --> 00:32:59.354
Zhou Zeyuan, Mr. Zhou.

00:32:59.675 --> 00:33:01.034
He's a rising star in tech.

00:33:01.635 --> 00:33:02.915
- Hello, Ms. Yu.
- Hello.

00:33:03.034 --> 00:33:04.395
Ms. Ma speaks highly of you.

00:33:04.834 --> 00:33:05.794
Just call me Randy.

00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:06.514
Randy.

00:33:07.955 --> 00:33:08.875
This is

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.354
Ms. Yu's daughter-in-law, Xu Yan.

00:33:12.034 --> 00:33:12.715
Ms. Ma.

00:33:13.274 --> 00:33:13.715
Hello.

00:33:13.995 --> 00:33:15.514
Hello, Miss Xu.

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:17.675
Hello.

00:33:19.074 --> 00:33:20.114
Let's sit over there.

00:33:22.074 --> 00:33:23.034
I prepared

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:23.995
your favorite tea.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:25.794
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

00:33:26.475 --> 00:33:28.235
No wonder you won't hang out with me.

00:33:28.314 --> 00:33:30.354
You prefer a younger company now.

00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:34.074
You know me best, Ms. Yu.

00:33:34.155 --> 00:33:35.274
I just love

00:33:35.635 --> 00:33:36.594
supporting

00:33:36.594 --> 00:33:37.754
young entrepreneurs.

00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:41.675
I met Randy at the venture forum,
and we hit it off.

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:43.834
So I'm introducing him to you.

00:33:44.754 --> 00:33:47.155
Randy, what exactly do you do?

00:33:48.034 --> 00:33:48.475
Ms. Yu,

00:33:48.915 --> 00:33:50.314
I work in new medical tech.

00:33:50.794 --> 00:33:52.915
I empower medical systems

00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:53.995
with cutting-edge tech,

00:33:54.554 --> 00:33:56.034
making healthcare accessible

00:33:56.274 --> 00:33:57.915
and streamlining doctors' work.

00:33:58.635 --> 00:33:59.155
Ms. Yu,

00:33:59.514 --> 00:34:01.794
this is the hottest field now.

00:34:01.915 --> 00:34:03.395
Young people today

00:34:03.594 --> 00:34:04.635
have talent

00:34:04.794 --> 00:34:05.675
and drive.

00:34:05.915 --> 00:34:07.715
They just need resources and chances.

00:34:08.435 --> 00:34:09.714
Supporting them

00:34:09.795 --> 00:34:10.875
benefits us too.

00:34:10.995 --> 00:34:12.514
It's a win-win.

00:34:19.714 --> 00:34:20.275
Ms. Yu,

00:34:21.074 --> 00:34:22.594
if I'm not mistaken,

00:34:22.714 --> 00:34:24.234
your outfit is from

00:34:24.475 --> 00:34:25.714
that famous Italian designer,

00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:26.915
Maygeogin, right?

00:34:27.275 --> 00:34:30.315
Yeah, it's the new model
they just released this year.

00:34:30.594 --> 00:34:33.594
This designer debuted recently
and is still niche.

00:34:33.915 --> 00:34:35.234
Few people know about her.

00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:37.514
How could you tell?

00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:39.995
She held a fashion show in New York

00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:41.154
when she graduated

00:34:41.435 --> 00:34:42.435
from Parsons,

00:34:42.435 --> 00:34:43.514
and we met there.

00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:45.875
Her works have a strong and impressive

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:46.955
personal style.

00:34:48.114 --> 00:34:50.275
I thought people in tech
and the internet industries

00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:52.114
weren't that interested in fashion.

00:34:52.594 --> 00:34:54.074
But you're a connoisseur.

00:34:56.714 --> 00:34:58.514
Mom, I'll get some hot water.

00:34:58.674 --> 00:34:59.755
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

00:34:59.755 --> 00:35:00.554
Take your time.

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:05.435
You know, Ms. Yu.

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:07.475
Randy mainly works on tech,

00:35:07.594 --> 00:35:09.634
but he has great connections.

00:35:09.634 --> 00:35:10.795
He has many friends from

00:35:10.795 --> 00:35:12.074
the fashion and art circles.

00:35:12.234 --> 00:35:14.194
His taste is impeccable.

00:35:19.154 --> 00:35:19.755
Miss Xu.

00:35:21.194 --> 00:35:22.674
Where's the restroom?

00:35:36.915 --> 00:35:38.514
Should I discuss with you

00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:41.234
or your mother-in-law

00:35:43.514 --> 00:35:44.674
about the investment?

00:35:45.634 --> 00:35:46.475
Zhou Zeyuan.

00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:52.475
Randy.

00:35:54.114 --> 00:35:55.234
You're being naive.

00:35:55.795 --> 00:35:57.154
Your business proposal

00:35:57.634 --> 00:35:58.795
and financial statements

00:35:59.194 --> 00:36:00.154
can't fool

00:36:00.154 --> 00:36:01.114
my mother-in-law

00:36:02.154 --> 00:36:03.275
or my husband.

00:36:04.674 --> 00:36:06.074
Forget about getting investment.

00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:09.835
Whether he invests

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:11.395
depends on how well you whisper

00:36:11.395 --> 00:36:12.435
in his ear.

00:36:13.835 --> 00:36:17.074
Besides, I'm only asking for
a tiny investment from him.

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:18.674
He won't care about it.

00:36:19.435 --> 00:36:20.114
What do you mean?

00:36:20.955 --> 00:36:21.875
In this circle,

00:36:22.114 --> 00:36:23.355
how much you get

00:36:23.554 --> 00:36:25.114
isn't as important as

00:36:25.114 --> 00:36:26.034
who you get it from.

00:36:26.435 --> 00:36:27.955
A hundred thousand from a tycoon

00:36:28.194 --> 00:36:29.594
is more valuable than

00:36:29.594 --> 00:36:31.674
five million from some island chief.

00:36:31.995 --> 00:36:33.755
For other investors,

00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:35.435
who back you up

00:36:35.435 --> 00:36:36.594
and endorse you,

00:36:36.755 --> 00:36:37.875
is their primary criterion

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:39.714
to judge your potential.

00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:41.714
That's why I never intended

00:36:41.714 --> 00:36:42.714
to have your husband

00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:44.154
make big investments.

00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:47.634
You want to use his reputation

00:36:47.634 --> 00:36:49.475
to attract more money, right?

00:36:55.435 --> 00:36:56.714
It just hit me

00:36:57.755 --> 00:36:58.995
how incredibly attractive

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:02.755
intelligent women look.

00:37:02.755 --> 00:37:03.755
You're disgusting.

00:37:04.674 --> 00:37:06.034
Let me make it clear.

00:37:06.995 --> 00:37:07.594
No.

00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:09.755
Xu Yan, you...

00:37:12.755 --> 00:37:13.514
Qiao Yan.

00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:16.234
This name makes us closer, doesn't it?

00:37:16.795 --> 00:37:17.995
Don't tell me that

00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:19.355
you genuinely

00:37:19.355 --> 00:37:20.594
love Shen Haoming,

00:37:20.634 --> 00:37:23.114
not his money, status,

00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:24.514
or his family's influence.

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.795
I don't owe you explanations.

00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:34.275
But you should know

00:37:35.634 --> 00:37:36.835
everything you're doing now

00:37:36.835 --> 00:37:38.475
is extortion and illegal.

00:37:39.315 --> 00:37:39.995
Qiao Yan.

00:37:40.795 --> 00:37:42.995
It's fascinating how much you're trying

00:37:43.034 --> 00:37:44.114
to protect Shen Haoming.

00:37:44.355 --> 00:37:46.034
You're actually love-struck.

00:37:46.634 --> 00:37:48.435
Let me tell you
the most ridiculous story

00:37:48.514 --> 00:37:49.795
I've heard this year.

00:37:50.154 --> 00:37:51.955
A common scammer married into wealth

00:37:51.955 --> 00:37:52.875
not for money,

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.475
but for true love.

00:37:54.795 --> 00:37:56.915
Isn't this more absurd
than fairy tales...?

00:38:07.594 --> 00:38:08.875
Thankfully, it's not burning.

00:38:11.234 --> 00:38:12.112
The dry-cleaning bill

00:38:13.475 --> 00:38:14.714
is included in the investment.

00:38:20.074 --> 00:38:21.034
So smart.

00:38:21.034 --> 00:38:22.395
Unbelievable.

00:38:22.395 --> 00:38:23.714
Ms. Yu, really,

00:38:24.034 --> 00:38:26.194
you've even trained Bu so well.

00:38:26.795 --> 00:38:28.275
You're amazing.

00:38:28.275 --> 00:38:29.355
I'm so clumsy.

00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:31.034
I splashed water everywhere

00:38:31.034 --> 00:38:32.275
when I washed my hands.

00:38:34.034 --> 00:38:35.315
You're hilarious.

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:36.315
It's okay.

00:38:36.435 --> 00:38:37.594
I'll have Yan bring

00:38:37.594 --> 00:38:38.835
Haoming's clothes.

00:38:38.835 --> 00:38:39.955
You can wear those.

00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:42.435
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Don't mention it.

00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:44.034
Is Ms. Yu's faucet at home

00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:45.634
too high-tech for you?

00:38:45.835 --> 00:38:47.554
It's different from mine.

00:38:47.634 --> 00:38:48.634
I got confused.

00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:49.634
No worries.

00:39:03.475 --> 00:39:04.835
- It's alright.
- Okay, Mr. Shen.

00:39:19.475 --> 00:39:20.034
Xu Yan.

00:39:20.514 --> 00:39:22.275
Sorry. The traffic was terrible.

00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:28.874
Mr. Shen, nice to meet you.

00:39:28.874 --> 00:39:30.835
I'm Zhou Zeyuan, Xu Yan's friend.

00:39:32.674 --> 00:39:33.360
Hello.

00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:35.074
Are you dining here too?

00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:36.594
Didn't Xu Yan inform you?

00:39:36.755 --> 00:39:37.875
She invited me here.

00:39:46.875 --> 00:39:47.915
I've been swamped

00:39:47.955 --> 00:39:48.955
and forgot to tell you.

00:39:49.808 --> 00:39:50.640
It's okay.

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:52.275
She said you'd be

00:39:52.275 --> 00:39:53.395
having lunch here.

00:39:53.674 --> 00:39:55.795
- So she invited me over.
- Okay.

00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:57.594
Mr. Shen, the dishes are ready.

00:39:58.915 --> 00:40:00.395
- An extra table setting.
- Yes, sir.
