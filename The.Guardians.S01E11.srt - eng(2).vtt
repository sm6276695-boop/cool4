If anything goes wrong,

Can you give me a shoulder pad?

No more padding.

Another pad and your ears will stick up.

But this is Shakespeare.

it just doesn't fit my story.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.300
I told you, don't move.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.940
If you move, I might miss.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.940
Hold on, wait a second.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.770
Gu Yangshan, just hear me out first.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.420
Maybe we should rethink our plan.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.650
There could be a better way.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.180
Wait.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.940
These two are clueless.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.300
They're actually serious.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.530
Report.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.530
The Joseph Lee you asked about,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.530
Inspector Li said they found him.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.650
Looks like I didn't miss.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.770
This isn't just a scratch.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.530
This is a serious wound.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.420
How does it feel to get shot?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.290
You jerk.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.250
I knew it, you really are one.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.140
Hurry up.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.420
Hand me the gun right now.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.490
I'll shoot you too, jerk.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.220
Have you ever fired a gun?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.420
No, I haven't.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.570
Never?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.180
We'll need to tweak the script.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.460
I took the bullet for you up close,

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.660
so let me pull the trigger.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.420
Okay, time's almost up.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.570
The Japanese should be here soon.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.570
Come on, let's head inside.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.980
You two, keep watch outside.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.940
Alright.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.570
Cool.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.940
You two are quite the team.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.940
Perfect.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.700
Nailed the meaning.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.940
Pick one.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.570
Lie down.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.570
See you in a bit.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.140
Seriously, man?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.810
You guys hide well.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.330
Don't let me work for nothing.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.940
Hello!

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.330
Go inside and check.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.900
Yes.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.180
Coffin? Sounds like coffer.
Means money's coming

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.810
and life's booming.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.940
One grenade blast,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.570
ten thousand taels of gold come.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.220
Found him.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.460
Stop!

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.180
Don't shoot.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.980
Mr. Takeda,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.220
I found the person you wanted.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.570
To search for Joseph Lee,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.660
I got hurt,

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.220
and so many of my guys died,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.940
I need you to give me
a lot more money.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.940
I still have to pay my men
the compensation payment.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.180
Okay?

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.420
Charlie.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.460
Charlie's still inside.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.940
Charlie.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.180
There's someone else here.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.330
It has to be Charlie.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.660
It must be Charlie, Mr. Takeda.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.330
Hurry, save him.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.660
Someone, help.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.900
Did you check their IDs?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.140
Yes, all clear.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.570
That Anti-Traitor Squad was amazing.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.810
But this guy,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.660
Joseph Lee's not up to much.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.420
He freaks out over nothing.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.660
We had to focus on saving him.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.020
But as for Charlie,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.740
good man.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.610
A real stand-up guy.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.610
Impressive.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.700
He stays calm no matter what happens.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.660
A good man.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.850
Who found him?

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.940
That person is gone.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.260
It was one of my people.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.370
The Anti-Traitor Squad took him out.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.220
Mr. Takeda,

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.940
everything's been checked.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.020
One of the bodies
was from the Anti-Traitor Squad.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.740
This coffin shop

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.260
might be one of their bases.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.980
It's my fault.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.980
I let a security gap happen here.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.180
Give the money to Inspector Li.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.980
Let him go.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.740
Yes.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.980
Good job.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.850
See you next time.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.220
Bye-bye.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.610
What?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.180
Are you kidding me?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.260
That's more like it.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.960
[Army Hospital]

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.980
Joseph Lee.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.020
Take care, Mr. Lee.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.220
My name's Ding Yi.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.460
I'm an actor.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.460
I've got a role for you.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.660
You're the true lead.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.260
If the Japanese

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.220
see through me,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.610
what do I even do then?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.130
We're talking about Takeda.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.850
If he flips out,
he'll even hurt his own guys.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.900
You know how he gets.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.940
Ding Yi!

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.130
She's gone!

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.850
She's gone, you get it? She's gone!

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.420
It's all I ever think about,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.610
he can't pretend to be blind forever.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.740
That's not the same thing.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.370
They've lost their lives already.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.980
Blinding him in one eye
won't change anything.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.850
Who are you?

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.700
I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.460
I'm not.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.260
I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.980
I'm really not.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.220
I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.180
I am.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.420
You just said you're not Joseph Lee.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.180
So who are you then?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.850
I even dream about it.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.940
If I run into the Anti-Traitor Squad,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.940
I'll say I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.660
Who should I say I am then?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.900
Just say you're a crew hand
at my troupe.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.980
With the way you look right now,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.370
you actually fit the part.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.700
Ms... Ms. Xian.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.940
Ms. Xian.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.460
How could you be so careless?

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.980
Look at how badly you hurt yourself.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.610
Ms. Xian, please don't worry.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.220
We're just putting on an act.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.980
We know how to pull our punches.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.130
Nothing happened to the bones.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.610
You two are way too bold.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.850
Do you realize how risky this is now?

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.900
Don't think that

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.420
just because Grand Duke Tonoji
covers you,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.900
you can do whatever you want.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.980
Takeda only needs one call

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.610
and he'll know

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.740
if the adopted son is real.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.940
Grand Duke Tonoji is close

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.700
to the Japanese Imperial Family.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.130
He once served as Ambassador to the UK.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.900
His position is extremely high.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.740
Back when he studied in Europe,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.940
he was a classmate
of Joseph Lee's father.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.610
The two of them are pretty close.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.370
After Grand Duke Tonoji
returned to Japan,

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.050
he invited Joseph Lee's father
over multiple times,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.260
mainly to work on cipher projects.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.020
So if that's the case,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.770
is it also possible

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.610
that the two of them

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.370
are sworn father and son?

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.180
No idea.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.500
Luckily, Grand Duke Tonoji
has no children,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.260
but for the Japanese,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.850
it's common to make sworn children.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.020
So it is possible
that he took Joseph Lee

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.460
as his sworn son.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.660
Wait,

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.180
but what if

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.740
their relationship isn't like that?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.460
You just said Takeda could call anytime.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.900
Wouldn't I be exposed then?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.850
Guess you've just been lucky.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.980
Grand Duke Tonoji

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.980
had a stroke not long ago

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.770
and he's still unconscious.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.460
But you need to leave Shanghai soon.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.260
Even though your ties
with Grand Duke Tonoji

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.420
aren't confirmed,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.290
Dr. Miyamoto will arrive any day now.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.260
You can't possibly hide

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.260
that you're not blind.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.180
I've come up with a plan.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.850
I got you a week's time.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:27.850
Hello?

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.370
Is this
Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Bureau?

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.260
You need to get to the dock right now.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.220
There are so many sick chickens here.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.220
It's really scary.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.460
Aren't you going to help?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.220
Okay, okay. Goodbye.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.460
There's an outbreak at the dock.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.130
Dr. Miyamoto's ship can't dock now.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.460
He can only wait outside the city.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.850
The authorities needs to check
for infections.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.180
It'll take seven days.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.460
During these seven days,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.460
we'll figure out how to get you out.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.220
Seven days.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.130
That's enough.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.980
Enough for what?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.980
To get revenge for Hongyu.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.660
Are you out of your mind?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.460
Ms. Xian,

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.500
I know Hongyu died
for the resistance against Japan.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.700
So,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.220
are you two

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:23.980
with the Eighth Route Army?

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.500
You don't have to say it. I get it.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.530
You can't just tell anyone who you are.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.610
But that's alright.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.290
I'm joining you.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.700
Let's get revenge for Hongyu together.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.420
So, what do you think?

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.530
If you're just after revenge,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.980
you're letting Hongyu's sacrifice down.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.020
Hongyu saved you,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.220
not so you'd throw your life away.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.020
But...

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.180
But Hongyu was one of your own.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.700
Someone from your side died,
and you don't care?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.740
One of your own lost life,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.900
aren't you going to do something?

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.980
Otherwise, my Hongyu died for nothing.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.220
Didn't she just die in vain?

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.850
Fighting Japan takes careful planning.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.220
Just charging in with a grenade

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.700
won't drive out the Japanese.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.850
If that worked, I'd go first.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.610
But a pointless sacrifice like this

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.130
won't make the Japanese leave.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.700
If that's what you believe,

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.980
I can't agree with you.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.420
At yesterday's military meeting,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.700
the Navy mocked us
over the cipher leak,

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.020
really giving us a hard time about it.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.700
They said people from the Army

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.370
shouldn't be running the MSS.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.850
Even if we did make a mistake,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.260
it's not their place to call us out.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.900
If we don't catch whoever leaked this,

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.850
everyone will think they can blame us.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.980
Joseph Lee and Xian Biyun
aren't ordinary.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.460
I've always suspected
there's more to them.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.740
What if the problem is
inside the MSS?

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.220
This...

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.180
If you suspect their background,
investigate.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.850
Find out the truth as soon as possible.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.420
Once Grand Duke Tonoji wakes up

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.980
and confirms Joseph Lee
as his adopted son,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.980
even if Joseph did leak the cipher,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.420
there'll be nothing we can do.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.130
You get what I'm saying?

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.660
No matter what the truth is,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.370
the one who leaked the cipher

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.940
can't be inside the MSS.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.700
Yes.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.610
What do you mean by that?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.690
Mr. Lee is blind. He can't see.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.090
I need to look after him!

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.300
Sorry.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.380
At Joseph Lee's place,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.980
our people are taking care of him.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.980
Your people?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.380
Can your people do what I do?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.020
I've always looked after his daily life.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.860
Can your people really handle it?

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.530
Listen,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.900
I have to look after Mr. Lee today.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.020
Sorry.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.860
If you keep this up,

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.130
I'm going to report you
to Mr. Takeda!

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.860
Charlie!

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.130
What are you even trying to do?

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.530
Charlie, Charlie.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.780
Mr. Lee? Mr. Lee.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.940
Charlie!

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.130
Mr. Lee.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.420
Is this what you call
caring for someone?

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.980
So this is your idea of help?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.820
Mr. Lee.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.340
Charlie.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.380
Mr. Lee.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:53.530
Mr. Lee.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.420
Move aside now!

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.820
Charlie, is that you? Charlie.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.300
Yeah, it's me.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.980
Is that you, Charlie?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.650
Charlie.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.980
That's great, that's really great.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.500
Mr. Lee.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.380
You're still alive.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.570
That's honestly amazing.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.530
We're at the Army Hospital,
so keep it down.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.530
I'm here to get you out of this.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.460
Work with me on this.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.570
That's perfect.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.900
Mr. Lee, let me help you upstairs.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.050
I thought you were gone.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.980
Sorry about that.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.610
Mr. Gu.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.980
Mr. Gu, you can't leave yet.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.460
You need to go back
to your hospital ward.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.900
Charlie is my eyes.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.300
Why separate us?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.980
Even if I go to the restroom,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.460
he's got to be within
five meters of me.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.250
Right now,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.340
send him back
to my hospital ward.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.730
Do it right away. Now!

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.980
Now!

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.530
Sir, we won't bother you anymore.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.730
Thank you.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.820
We barely got through last night.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.460
But Dr. Miyamoto will still show up.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.250
Seven days.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.250
Will these injuries of mine

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.300
heal all the way in seven days?

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.730
Seven days for what?

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.250
Ms. Xian just told me,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.050
Dr. Miyamoto was supposed
to reach Shanghai soon,

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.780
but she used avian influenza

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.730
to buy us seven days.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.460
I know what you're thinking.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:37.860
But no matter what,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.340
before Dr. Miyamoto arrives,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.250
I have to get you out of here.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.500
Either way,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.340
in these seven days,

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.530
I have to take out Takeda.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.570
Ding Yi, I want to as well.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.130
I want to stop every invader here.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.460
But look at things now,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.650
we can't even get close to them.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.530
How do we take him out?

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.090
Then I'll poison myself blind.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.250
I'll finish
the Sword Thrust Operation for you.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.090
You help me take down Takeda.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.340
Let's team up.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.980
You're being ridiculous.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.900
Your top priority is
leaving here.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.900
Keep yourself safe first.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.780
If you're safe, then you get
a chance for revenge.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.650
I've already helped you so much.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.050
Can't you help me just this once?

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.940
No, I can't.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.820
If you don't, I'll give you up.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.650
Excuse me?

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.730
Who's this?

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.530
Mr. Lee, it's Kobayashi.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.650
What's he here for?

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.340
Probably to tell you
the check got delayed.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.570
Captain Kobayashi.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:57.940
Is that Captain Kobayashi?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.500
Mr. Lee.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.460
Is Dr. Miyamoto here too?

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.730
I've waited so long for you.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.610
My eyesight...

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.780
I finally have hope for my eyes.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.780
Mr. Lee, you've got the wrong person.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.460
Where is Dr. Miyamoto?

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.650
He hasn't arrived yet.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.500
What?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.940
But Captain Kobayashi said

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.300
Dr. Miyamoto was supposed to come today.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.530
Dr. Miyamoto's ship

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.570
can't dock for now.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.940
Why's that?

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.980
Mr. Lee,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.340
we just got word about it.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.300
Sorry to have to tell you.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.130
There's a suspected avian influenza
at the dock.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.130
To be on the safe side,

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.860
Dr. Miyamoto will have to
stay on the ship.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.900
To be on the safe side,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.530
Dr. Miyamoto has to stay on the ship.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.130
Avian influenza?

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.570
So, how much longer will this last?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.090
According to the rules,

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.300
it's seven days.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.980
Seven days?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.780
Are you guys just brushing me off?

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.050
You told me before
that Dr. Miyamoto was busy.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.500
And I let it slide.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.530
But he's here now,

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.340
why won't you let him meet me?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.340
Tell me,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.130
do you have any other conditions?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.340
Mr. Lee, please don't be upset.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.130
We're not breaking our word.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.460
There really is an outbreak
at the dock.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.460
Now we suspect that

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.500
someone's trying to mess
with our army.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.130
Mr. Takeda has handled it already.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.980
The Navy has joined the investigation.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.900
I think we'll get results soon.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.780
Mr. Takeda is already on it.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.820
Also, the Navy...

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.610
Anyway,

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.460
Mr. Lee, please wait patiently.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.500
So, Mr. Lee, please be patient.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.980
Tomorrow,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.340
we'll bring Dr. Miyamoto back.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.780
Tomorrow?

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.340
Well, I'll leave you to it.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.420
Why did it suddenly move to tomorrow?

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.900
That can't be.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.570
Why not?

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.050
I'm talking to you.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.050
The Japanese Army and Navy

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.460
have always had strategic conflicts.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.780
But Takeda is just

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.050
a manager at the MSS.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.940
How can he mobilize the Navy?

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.980
What do you mean?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.980
Kobayashi just slipped up.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.460
He said Takeda moved the Navy.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.340
While it was translated,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.900
he suddenly realized it

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.460
and stopped right away.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.780
He didn't want us to know.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.050
We don't have time to worry now.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.340
You need to tell Ms. Xian fast.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.940
The eye check is moved up to tomorrow.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.050
We have to find a way through this.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.340
I can't blow my cover yet.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.050
Navy...

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:24.860
[Shanghai Japan Naval Club]

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.660
I've sent someone

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.250
to talk to the Port Office

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.460
of the Epidemic Prevention Bureau.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.090
I can't promise about tomorrow.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.780
But no later than the day after,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.570
we'll definitely get through.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.610
Thank you, brother.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:43.980
Idiot.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.570
I've already told you.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.820
Don't call me that out here.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.530
Sorry.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.610
Colonel Kumamoto.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.460
Please, sit down.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:13.500
Here's the medical file
you asked for.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.040
I got help from intelligence personnel

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.610
stationed in the UK.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:18.820
That's how I managed to get it.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.530
It was risky enough already.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.530
For things like this from now on,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.500
don't come to me again.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.460
Sorry for the trouble.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.460
If you do this again,

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.530
you'll be sent home right away.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.900
You really don't think things through.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.090
Don't drag the Kumamoto Family
into this.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.090
