00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.280
I just left for two days.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960
And you caused such chaos at home?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.000
Shi'an.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.680
I'm not scolding you,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.600
but our family is facing calamity now.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.680
You should focus more
on the family business.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.280
You can't leave everything to me.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.920
I've always hoped

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.040
you'd grow strong enough
to lead our family soon.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.440
Grandmother,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.280
I know I was wrong.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.840
And you,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560
calm your temper too.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.440
Shi'an is still in mourning.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080
He can't take concubines,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.880
and his relationship
with Jinzhi is strained.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.640
You're the only one

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.880
who truly understands him now.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.720
He momentarily lost his judgment.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.080
Just scold him a bit
and let this pass, alright?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.280
Grandmother,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.520
don't pin it on me.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.240
It really wasn't me.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.960
Madam, Master Shi'an,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.160
I mean no offense.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.440
The culprit isn't hard

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.640
to identify.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.320
Just see who benefited most from this.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.640
The servants say

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.440
Lady Jinzhi emerged
from the study at dawn.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.560
What?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.120
It wasn't you last night?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.920
Xia Jinzhi,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.200
was it truly you who drugged us?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.080
You made me lose composure before A'man,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.440
and appear heartless.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.680
It wasn't me, Shi'an.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.160
You dared make A'man
drink safflower potion.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.480
What won't you stoop to?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.200
Go explain for me.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.640
Go.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.520
Go no!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000
You talk about A'man all the time.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.880
Do I not exist in your eyes?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.240
I've never been worthy of your gaze.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.120
Isn't it laughable you ask this now?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.400
Shi'an.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.520
Please listen to me, Shi'an.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.880
I admit

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.640
that when my father forced this marriage

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.960
and you favored Concubine Ye,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880
I felt wronged.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.400
That's why I treated you coldly.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.280
But I'll change.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.160
I won't treat you as I did before.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Don't you prefer Ye Qinglan's demeanor?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.440
I can do as she did.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.160
Give me one more chance, please?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.520
After all the harm you caused A'man,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320
how could I ever trust you?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.680
Step aside.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.240
Lu Shi'an!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.120
Is there not a shred of love for me
in your heart?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.160
Not at all.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.000
Not at all...

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.400
Not at all?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.360
This is for you.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.880
For me?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.720
My pearl.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.960
Lady.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.400
Put the drug in the fireworks.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.760
You may leave.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.520
I don't understand.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.120
Prefect Xia bribed the maid
to drug me and Lu Shi'an.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.280
What does he gain from this?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.400
He learned about the decree I possess

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.000
and feared I'll show mercy
to the Lus because of you.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.000
So he wanted to use
your entanglement with Lu Shi'an

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.960
to drive a wedge
between me and the Lu family.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.240
Why such convoluted schemes?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.920
If the Lus were truly involved,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.440
he could've informed you directly.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.280
He wanted plausible deniability,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.640
avoiding being seen as their accomplice.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.320
His fear of Madam Lu runs deep.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.040
You've overreached into my affairs.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.840
How has the Lu family offended you?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.200
Madam,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.440
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.560
I-I meant to drug Shen Que
and that concubine.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.640
The plan went awry.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.360
My deepest apologies.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.720
When our family faced crisis before,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.520
your external negotiations

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.240
saved us.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.840
I appreciate your kindness.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.680
But now, with the Governor-General
targeting us,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.920
unity is more crucial than ever.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.640
Yes, yes. You're right.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.440
Ciyi,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.160
you were the good child I chose myself.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.160
Don't disappoint me.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.120
The kindness you showed to me

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
has never been forgotten.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400
Good.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.120
Thank you, Madam.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.040
So...

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.800
Should Madam Lu be informed

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.920
that Prefect Xia isn't aligned with her?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.000
She already knows.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.200
When you arrived just now,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.320
she had just left with Chenghuan.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.520
Where do you think

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.600
she'd go at this late hour?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.000
Shen Que.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.440
Something feels off about her chamber.

00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:10.600
Are you sure something's off here?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.720
Yes.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.280
These are illicit ledgers
for pearl smuggling.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.360
Look.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.200
It records payments

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.320
sent every three months

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.960
to the Dong family.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.440
Why record this?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.480
Someone's here.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.000
Madam, you've worked
through half the night.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.240
You should rest now.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.680
Every day,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.560
there's no peace to be found.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.640
I can't sleep.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.640
There's rice cakes
Concubine Ye brought today.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.760
Want some?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.720
No.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.240
My stomach's been unsettled
since dinner.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.040
Madam,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.200
Concubine Ye has been hovering
around you lately.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.160
Could she know Jin was poisoned here?

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.720
Whether she knows or not,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.240
entrusting Jin to Shen Que

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.800
proves she's no longer loyal
to the Lu family.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.200
Then why keep her close?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.480
Someone's been here.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.840
Could it be Ye Qinglan?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.360
Whether it's her or not,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.640
she can't live.

00:10:19.392 --> 00:10:20.440
Use this to investigate.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.760
(Dong)
Find his connection to Madam Lu.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.640
We've gathered enough evidence.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.880
Now let them tear each other apart.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.760
I'll leave.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:35.960
A'man.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.320
You should leave the Lu family too.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.840
Let me take you away.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.240
We'll find Jin together.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.480
Okay.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.680
Meet me tomorrow night
in Duting Station's back alley.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.840
Okay.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.880
Open up!

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.960
Who is it?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.520
Need your boat to transport goods.

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:18.680
Which household do you...

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.280
What's the...

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.520
Come with us.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.320
Where to?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.800
Go!

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.680
Kneel!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.160
Does this place look familiar?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.440
I-I don't know.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.920
I've never been here.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.000
Listen, old man.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.720
Get this straight.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.200
Those men outside want you dead.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.640
I just have several questions.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.000
Why fear me?

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.320
My lord,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.160
I-I truly know nothing.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.520
You'll stay here until your pursuers

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.040
are caught.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.440
Our lord has ordered

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.280
to ensure your safety.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.960
Who is your lord?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.320
An old friend of Princess Anhe.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.760
Could I get some food?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.600
I haven't eaten in days.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.640
Send her to the dock now.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.920
What about the child?

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.680
Already evacuated. Rest easy.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.520
Hyah!

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.920
Whoa!

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.480
My lady, a household ahead.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.080
Dismount for water and rest.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.240
My lady?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.520
My lady?

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.840
Did Princess Anhe reside
at Duting Station previously?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.440
Wh-Who is this official?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.840
Ask no unnecessary questions.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.480
Speak.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.920
Yes.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.720
Who delivered the last meal

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.760
served to Princess Anhe?

00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:02.800
It was the postmaster.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.280
Sang Huai...

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:09.880
Yes.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.680
Princess Anhe's meals were all handled
by the postmaster.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.440
Do you know the consequences
of lying to me?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.920
My lord, my life rests in your hands.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.880
How would I dare deceive you?

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.160
Gao Fu.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.960
Yes.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.680
Investigate all clinics and pharmacies.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.920
Verify Duting Station's purchase records
before Princess Anhe's death.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.680
Understood.
