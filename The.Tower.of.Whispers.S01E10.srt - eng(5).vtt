Is this

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.470
the feeling of falling in love?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.030
It looks like the Chief Commander

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.090
really has feelings for Lu Yingying.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.680
He wanted to use her,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.880
but he ended up falling in love with her.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.660
I just wonder if it's worth it.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Come on. Let's drink.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.570
Let's drink!

Waiter!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.080
Give us another pot of wine!

May I share the table with you?

Gentlemen, here's your wine.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.520
It's you, Mr. Li.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.070
Have a seat.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.270
What's wrong, buddy?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.269
I-I'm fine.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.390
I've heard a joke recently.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.200
Let me tell you about it.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.950
There was a brave man

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.390
who was lying in bed.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.390
However, his back was extremely itchy,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.800
but he couldn't move.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.720
What do you think was the reason?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.920
Because "A coward always turns his back
while a brave man doesn't."

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.560
Mr. Li.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.710
This joke is quite funny.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.720
But why can't I laugh out loud today

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.190
after hearing such a funny joke?

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.560
If you don't want to laugh,
just don't laugh.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.820
Let's just drink as much as we want today.

Okay!

but also tricked me
into buying you a drink.

-We can't kill him.
-We can't kill him.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.600
He's a Longxiang Guard
and has a special status.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480
If we kill him, the imperial court
will conduct an investigation,

If we don't kill him,
maybe we can even use him.

In this way, it'll be beneficial
to the progress of our plans.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.870
However, if we let him go,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.270

use the Heart-Binding Poison on him?

Didn't you talk about
driving Five away last night?

I was too prejudiced against him before.

Then after just one night,
how did you two suddenly...

It's better to resolve enmity

"Are you blind?"

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.910
