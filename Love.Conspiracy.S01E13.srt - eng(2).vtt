can't you consider
the difficult position I'm in?

Once the company goes public,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.420
if I don't have
absolute controlling interest,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.060
don't you think investor confidence

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.140

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.540
Wenhan.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.940
Calm down and let me explain!

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.060
I don't want to hear it!

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.620
What's the point?

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.940
Then what do you want?

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.780
First,

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.900
get my mom out.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.060
Second,

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.620
prepare money

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.900
to get me and my mom out of here safely.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.100
I'm already working on all that.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.220
Your mom will be released
on bail pending trial soon.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.820
I'll get the money together.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.580
But you need

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.980
to lay low here

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.700
during this time.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.500
Don't cause any more trouble.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.060
I hope

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.420
you keep your word this time.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.380
How is Nie Wenzhi's case going?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.940
Her detention period has expired.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.100
But the case needs further trial.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.940
She provided proof

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.140
of a serious medical condition
to the police,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.060
so she's been released
on bail pending trial.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.060
But don't worry.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.020
She's committed so many crimes.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.620
She won't get away with this.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.740
Dad,

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.860
just rest at home.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.220
Don't worry about anything.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.980
Tomorrow you'll chair

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.220
your first company meeting
as General Manager.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.380
Are you ready?

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.740
I'm ready.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.340
Last time I left,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.940
this was a full, bustling house.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.740
Now

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.380
it feels empty.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.060
The family is broken.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.140
If we hadn't discovered
Wenzhi's true nature,

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.260
maybe

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.980
we could have just kept living together.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.220
Dad,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.540
what's done is done.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.940
Even if we played dumb,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.900
everything in this house

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.740
would still be a facade.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.100
All good things must come to an end.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.060
We have to embrace change.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.260
Look at you, Zhizhi.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.260
You're full of wisdom now.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.260
You've changed so much.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.860
You weren't like this before.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.460
After everything that's happened,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.660
it's time I grew up.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.100
My little girl

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.900
really has grown up.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.420
I remember
when you were learning to walk.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.820
You'd take two steps and fall,

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.500
sitting on the ground crying.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.500
And I'd pick you up

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.060
again and again,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.700
until you finally learned.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.220
Since you were little,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.900
I've been afraid of you getting hurt

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.940
or bullied.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.500
I always wanted to protect you

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.820
with everything I had.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.500
But you'd grow up anyway

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.220
and have to face
this complicated world on your own.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.140
You earned the position

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.140
of Acting General Manager yourself.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.060
I'm really happy for you.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.940
Zhizhi,

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.980
you will surpass me.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.580
You'll do even better.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.140
Dad,

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.060
am I your pride?

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:33.900
Good morning, everyone.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.140
As Mr. Song is currently

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.940
feeling unwell,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.140
I'm chairing my first company meeting

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.060
as the Acting General Manager today.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.460
Let's have each department head

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.100
report on this week's progress.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.740
Regarding the Quefeng series campaign,

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.500
the influencers we've contacted

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.540
think partnering with us is too risky

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.100
after the Chuxin incident.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.980
They're all making
outrageous demands now,

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.140
threatening to pull out

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.180
unless we pay them more.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.140
Then scrub the list.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.100
Find younger influencers

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.860
with more potential
and better attitudes.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.380
Also,

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.900
the collaborative project
with the overseas Anya Corp

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.100
has tied up
most of next quarter's production funds.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.660
Finance

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.380
is still waiting for the capital
to be returned.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.260
The company's overall cash flow
is extremely tight.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860
We're really stretched thin

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.580
for operating funds.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.100
Regarding the company's finances,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.660
I need everyone

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.460
to stay confident.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.740
These difficulties are temporary.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.260
I will find a solution.

Zhizhi, bad news.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.780
The collaborative project
with Anya Corp

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.100
has tied up
most of our production funds.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.220
I just got word.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.060
They've declared bankruptcy.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.720
[Bankruptcy Declaration of Anya Corp]

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.140
How could such a basic mistake happen?

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.100
This was a Design Department project

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.380
that started before you became
the Acting General Manager.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.820
It was seen as questionable
due to the high capital commitment

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.780
and long cycle.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.060
But somehow
the senior management approved it,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.420
so they had to proceed.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.140
Which senior executive approved it?

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.900
How could anyone approve
a project like that?

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.340
I've looked into it.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.220
Nie Wenzhi did it behind the scenes

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.780
during the chaos
of the shareholders' meeting.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.100
So Nie Wenzhi

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:47.820
was plotting

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.180
against the company from that far back?

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.500
Now next quarter's production funds

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.260
are frozen.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.860
If the production line funding dries up,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.100
the Quefeng series
will likely be halted.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.780
Ms. Song, we have a problem
with the bank.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.100
Our loan application was rejected.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.020
They probably got wind of our situation

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.420
and don't want to take the risk.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.140
We need to keep this quiet.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.780
Alright.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.660
If this gets out,

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.980
it could seriously impact the company.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.900
Understood. I'll leave then.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.420
At this rate,
forget developing new products,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.700
even keeping the company running
will be a problem.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.100
Nie Wenzhi

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.420
schemed to take my dad's assets.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.900
