00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.120
and let me give up this hope.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.810
♪ The blood in my heart
is the spell of love ♪

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.670
♪ I'll never miss you again in my dream ♪

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.790
Five.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.760
You're truly insane.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.300
♪ When everything turns into smoke,
I hope we can stay peaceful forever ♪

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.840
This obsessive feeling

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.410
is exactly like Jun Che from my past life.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.840
Could he

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.600
be destined to become that madman?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.270
So it was really you

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.050
who gave your blood to heal me yesterday.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.750
My Lady, please don't worry about it.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.810
I did it willingly.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.950
So beautiful.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.360
Yingying.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.080
Got you.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.910
Let me kill him.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.670
You are my wife.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.240
How could I ever let you go?
