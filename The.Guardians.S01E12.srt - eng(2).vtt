[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 12]

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.180
Wu.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.380
How is it?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.180
Biyun,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.260
the Organization thinks

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.380
since the theater's been sealed,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.820
the Japanese will drop their guard here,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.180
so this place is actually safer now.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.380
We're supposed to stay put for now.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.980
The Organization supports our next plan,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.660
and thinks we're on the right track.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.980
They'll send more people too.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.020
But,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.410
personally,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.180
I'm still unsure about
working with Gu Yangshan.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.820
I'll be careful with it.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.380
Hello?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.540
Who are you looking for?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.340
Just a second.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.380
Gu Yangshan.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.340
Charlie.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.380
Let me introduce everyone.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.660
This is Frank.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.890
He's the Deputy Commander

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.820
of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.940
This is Charlie,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.220
an assistant to Mr. Lee.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.780
Well, Ms. Xian has told me
so much about you.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.780
Pleasure to meet you.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.220
Nice to meet you, Frank.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.500
Please, have a seat.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.780
There's a new development
with the dock plan.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.500
I noticed
your London accent is quite standard.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.380
Have you ever been to London before?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.660
Yeah, I studied in London before.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.940
Ah, of course.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.260
And what did you study there?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.890
Math.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.100
It's a really difficult subject.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.940
I know.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.980
Math was never my strong point.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.690
Frank.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.940
Thank you for coming today.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.660
Okay, no problem.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.540
So we're done here?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.540
- Finished?
- Finished.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.410
It's my pleasure.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.660
See you next time.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.340
Bye.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.610
But there's a bigger problem now.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.380
After Takeda left the Naval Club,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.980
he headed to Dr. Schwarz's clinic,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.980
who is a top brain specialist in Europe.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.380
As far as I know,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.660
he's the only doctor in Shanghai

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.260
who does cerebral angiography now.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.610
I figure Takeda went to see him,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.290
because he must have gotten
the medical records.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.170
Then he teamed up
with the eye specialist,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.420
so they could consult
for Ding Yi together.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.700
Joseph Lee lost his vision

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.260
due to pressure from his pituitary gland
on his optic nerve.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.890
So Ms. Xian,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.700
if what you said is true

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.210
that Dr. Schwarz

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.090
is truly skilled at imaging technology,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.210
then no need to wait until tomorrow,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.890
we'll be exposed right away.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.580
Yes.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.890
Even if you go all out

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.700
and use that toxin on him

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.820
to harm his optic nerve,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.820
you still can't

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.330
fake an identical tumor.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.820
Don't worry, Ms. Xian,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.820
I won't agree to let my people

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.090
do this kind of thing

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.450
on him.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.290
I'm not trying to pressure you.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.740
I just think

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.580
when the time comes,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.330
you and Gu Yangshan might need this.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.330
[Praxis Dr. Schwarz; Dr. Meng Jie]

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.940
This is where I work.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.740
I'm there during the day.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.060
You can find me anytime.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.410
Ms. Xian, maybe I have one more way.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.580
It was unexpected
for Miyamoto to dock early,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.740
but Takeda exposed his Navy ties.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.820
From Kobayashi's reaction,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.580
Sasaki might not know about this.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.020
Now there's tension
between the Navy and the Army.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.500
If we let Sasaki know,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.940
as long as he's a bit suspicious,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.140
we'll get a chance.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.640
[Praxis Dr. Schwarz]

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.700
Good afternoon.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.260
Hello, do you have an appointment?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.380
Actually, I'm looking for Dr. Meng.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.380
Please tell her

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.940
that her friend is coming
to pick up the suit.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.700
Okay, sure.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.380
Thank you.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.380
The U.S. Military created a neurotoxin.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.380
Just one drop into your eyes,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.620
in less than five minutes,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.820
it'll damage the optic nerve completely.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.260
Meng Jie,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.260
this one's for you.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.860
Bingqing, this one's for you.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.460
Wisteria smells better when dried.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.500
But as it air dries,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.980
don't hang it straight by the window.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.500
Direct sunlight will fade the color.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.140
Wait until it's fully dry
before the sun.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.140
It's been so long.
I thought you'd forget.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.500
Mr. Charlie.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.650
Charlie.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.460
Thanks.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.380
When drying wisteria,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.260
don't just leave it by the window.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.860
If it gets direct sun, it'll fade.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.620
You have to wait till it's fully dry,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.500
then you can finally let it
see the light.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.860
It's really you.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.740
You're Shixian.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.740
Long time no see, Meng Jie.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.020
You've grown up a lot.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.740
Never thought we'd meet again
after so long.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.020
Actually, at the ball that night,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.500
I recognized you right away.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.460
So why didn't you say
anything to me?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.260
It's a long story.
I'll explain it next time.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.500
Why not today?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.260
Let's sit and talk it over.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:31.740
Alright.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.500
Don't trouble yourself.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.340
Actually, I'm here to ask
for your help.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.140
I have a friend,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.020
whose pituitary tumor
is pressing on his optic nerve.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.620
He's suffering from
terrible headaches lately.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.260
And his vision's gotten worse too.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.500
Pituitary tumor?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.220
Yeah.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.220
Dr. Schwarz is an expert in this area.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.740
If he doesn't mind,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.860
he could come by the hospital.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.860
But I heard

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.620
getting this test done

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.020
can be really risky
for one's body, right?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.380
That's true.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.340
Cerebral angiography is invasive.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.100
The doctor's skill really matters here.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.410
The technique
hasn't been perfect yet.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.930
So many patients who get the test

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.930
are at risk of developing

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.810
permanent neurological deficits.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.140
So, unless it's urgent

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.100
and surgery just can't wait,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.380
we usually don't recommend this test.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.140
But you came to the right person.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.740
Dr. Schwarz is the only one in Shanghai,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.260
who can do this test right now.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.020
So,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.220
let's say my friend

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.260
doesn't want to take this test,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.260
but he's forced to do it.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.260
Would you go along with that?

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.620
Forcing him?

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.100
Yes.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.650
Of course not.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.860
We respect the patient's wishes.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.740
If he isn't healthy enough,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.500
we can't run this test.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.260
What if someone forced you?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.020
Still no,

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.380
that's just our medical ethics.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.140
But now my friend's being made

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.620
to come here to your clinic,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.620
asking Dr. Schwarz for the test.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.340
Your friend...

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.050
Is he that blind gentleman

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.020
from the banquet the other night?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.500
Yes, and his medical records

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.020
should've already reached your clinic.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.740
Mr. Takeda...

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.220
did send the records over.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.810
His name is...

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.500
Jo... Joseph Lee.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.020
That's Mr. Lee.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.410
No wonder,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.740
Dr. Schwarz found it odd that night.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.740
The patient already had a successful

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.620
cerebral angiography.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.620
Why did Takeda want it done again?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.340
Here's the thing, Meng Jie.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.980
Mr. Lee's current condition,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.260
both physically and mentally,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.260
can't handle that kind of ordeal.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.740
So the favor I want to ask of you is

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.890
whether it is possible

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.050
to cancel the checkup

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.690
for Mr. Lee tomorrow?

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.410
If it were up to me,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.890
yeah, I could do it.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.410
But I can't decide for Dr. Schwarz.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.650
Dr. Schwarz

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.770
has always avoided
upsetting the Japanese.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.100
I'm just his student.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.220
I probably can't change his mind.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.340
Ding Yi!

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.500
Hongyu...

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.220
Someone's been killed! Someone's dead!

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.740
Give it back to me!

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.740
What is it? Are you out of your mind?

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.500
So what now?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.220
Tell me, what can we even do now?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.220
So,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.740
now you get it, right?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.530
The top priority

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.860
is to run this test for you.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.220
You really should check this out.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.500
So, what did your childhood friend say?

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.740
Did she tell you how to

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.980
keep them from checking on me?

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.500
She did.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:47.980
Just use this.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:20.960
[Comprehensive Building]

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.740
They're here.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.500
Dr. Schwarz has arrived.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.860
Good morning.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.980
Cerebral angiography carries some risks.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.020
We'll need to run a full exam
on the patient.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.100
Please wait outside.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.500
Mr. Lee, I'll step out for now.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.020
Dr. Meng will get your arm ready
ahead of time.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.740
No matter how they check tomorrow,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.290
they'll find your blood pressure high.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.500
That way, Dr. Schwarz
won't dare to run the test.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.330
Doctor, am I dying?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.770
High blood pressure can
make you dizzy and queasy.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.380
Right now, you're playing

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.980
someone who's lost too much blood.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.020
Professor, could you come here?

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.370
The patient's blood pressure is off.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.420
Systolic is at 180.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.740
Check it again.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.500
Okay.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.660
Systolic is now 190.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.570
Do you want to take a listen?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.810
Dr. Schwarz.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.290
Is there something wrong here?

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.460
Oh my god.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.050
If you want me to examine
in this condition,

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.290
you're just wasting my time.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.850
There are still patients
waiting at my clinic.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.290
Today's session ends here.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.460
Dr. Meng, what did Dr. Schwarz just say?

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.290
The patient has
ongoing high blood pressure.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.810
Right now, he's not fit
for further exams.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.060
The doctor suggests starting medication

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.330
to lower the pressure first.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.810
We'll reassess after that.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.810
So when can we do the next check?

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.020
Mr. Takeda,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.290
this exam is invasive and risky.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.290
A small mistake could be fatal.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.940
About the follow-up timing,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.980
I'll inform you when it's set.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.770
Dr. Meng,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.050
Mr. Lee

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.570
is a key partner for us.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.290
We're really concerned about him.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.130
How much longer do we have to wait

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.330
before checking him again?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.050
We need you to give us

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.850
a clear answer right now.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.460
Mr. Takeda,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.810
why put Dr. Meng on the spot?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.050
Honestly, Mr. Lee doesn't even

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.530
need more angiography tests.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.050
So why did you invite Dr. Schwarz

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.050
and Dr. Meng here today?

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.420
Was it to help him,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.290
or was it to hurt him?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.020
Charlie!

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.050
Grab my antihypertensive medication.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.460
My head's about to burst!

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.050
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.050
Are you alright?

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.290
I'm fine.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.460
I just got too scared back there.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.850
Sorry, Shixian.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.660
I've always been like this
since I was a kid.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.050
Way too timid.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.610
I know.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.290
But,

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.220
today, you were really brave.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.810
You honestly helped us out,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.850
more than you know.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.740
So,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.660
Meng Jie, thank you.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.460
If there's ever anything I can do,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.500
just let me know.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.130
I'm always here to help.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.570
Shixian.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.980
Don't worry.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.290
I'm happy to do all this.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.900
I almost forgot.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.610
We're not kids anymore.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.330
I should head back to the hospital.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.570
By the way,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.770
I just thought of something.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.330
There's a medicine called
chlorpheniramine.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.290
If you take a lot of it fast,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.810
your pupils get really big.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.050
It looks a lot like vision loss.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.020
For someone like Mr. Lee,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.290
that'll fool any eye doctor.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.050
You...

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.050
Shixian,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.290
don't worry.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.020
I get it.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.330
You have your reasons.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.740
I won't tell anyone.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.050
I've never tried this way before.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.770
So I can't say if it'll work.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.050
You guys should think it over.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.290
Alright.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.090
I'm heading out.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.570
Meng Jie.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.180
Thanks.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.330
Thank you.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.050
What's the name again?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.810
- Chlorpheniramine.
- Chlorpheniramine.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.050
Chlorpheniramine.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.130
Take care.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.050
See you.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.570
"Shixian."

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.290
"I get it.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.050
You have your reasons."

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.020
"Don't worry.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.900
I won't tell anyone."

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.220
Can you please stop messing around?

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.570
She's so nervous

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.810
just now.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.050
And you're still teasing her.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:23.420
Seriously, man.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.850
I'm anxious for you, you know.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.570
Miss Meng really does care about you.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.610
Meanwhile, look at you.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.570
You're like a block of wood.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.130
All you ever say is thanks.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.290
Guns and math, is that all you can do?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.940
Right now, with everything happening,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.330
I can't even think about that.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.810
This challenge,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.460
Meng Jie helped us get through it.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.330
But I think Dr. Miyamoto will show up.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.020
We can't just sit back anymore.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.020
We need to start taking control.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.220
I didn't do anything.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.330
Please spare me.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.330
I didn't do anything.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.330
Please spare me.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.290
I swear I'm innocent.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.050
Please spare me.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.090
He helped that Army deserter

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.810
to disguise him as a patient

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.050
and sneak onto the transport ship,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.500
trying to run back to Japan.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.090
A total disgrace to our Navy.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.570
Colonel,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.850
the Army Hospital called.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.570
Joseph Lee wants a meeting with you.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.980
Colonel,

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.260
that Joseph Lee

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.290
always speaks with sarcasm

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.850
and stirs up trouble for fun.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.500
This kind of request

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.850
is jumping the chain of command.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.020
We can't let it slide.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.330
I'll go deal with him.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.050
Colonel,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.020
don't waste your time here.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.050
But honestly, I'm curious.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.330
What kind of person could this

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.050
sworn son of Grand Duke Tonoji be?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.980
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.810
Takeda has arrived.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.850
Mr. Lee, your report is for me.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.810
What made you want to skip over me

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.290
and take things straight to the Colonel?

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.610
Honestly, some things are pointless

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.330
to bring up to you.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:49.980
So,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:51.810
I have to tell the Colonel myself.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.810
Mr. Lee, maybe explain,

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.050
what exactly doesn't help?

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:58.710
Okay.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.050
I was very clear with you before,

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.850
I don't want to do that examination,

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.020
because

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.500
it could seriously hurt my brain.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.460
But you keep pushing me to do it.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.850
Do you not trust me at all?

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.290
Why would you even say that?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.050
Back at the Metropolitan Hotel,
I was attacked in public.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.850
The Anti-Traitor Squad
kidnapped me after.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.020
Given my current health,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.050
I'm really not able to
handle testing like that.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.610
Yet Mr. Takeda,
you insist I go.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.500
You clearly want me gone for good.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.850
Oh, I get it now.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.770
Are you really just getting back at me,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.290
all because the cipher
was leaked last time

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.570
and I made you lose face?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.260
So,

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.220
you're just trying to
make me pay for it.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.290
Am I right?

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.570
Mr. Lee,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.570
we're all working
for the Empire of Japan.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.500
We shouldn't stress over these things.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.810
If that's what you came to talk about,

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.770
there's no need to bother the Colonel.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.980
You could've told me directly.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.570
Besides,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.570
this checkup

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.290
is really for your own good.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.700
For my own good?

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.050
I honestly don't get it.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.850
Mr. Takeda, if you mean well,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.740
why risk my safety

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.500
and make me go through
that invasive test?

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.050
But if you don't care,

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.050
why mobilize the Navy?

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.260
Why call on the Navy,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.500
just to bring Dr. Miyamoto,

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.810
so he can treat my eyes?

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.740
Just to bring Dr. Miyamoto.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.220
I'm not wrong, am I, Charlie?

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.570
That's right, Mr. Lee.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.500
Captain Kobayashi said it himself.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.570
Dr. Miyamoto

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.570
is quarantined on the ship
for avian influenza.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.050
Takeda, you personally
moved the Navy in.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.850
That's enough!

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.330
Mr. Lee.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.850
Don't believe those rumors.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.530
I really had no idea before,

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.500
this checkup could actually do harm.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.090
Now I get it.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.740
If you're not up for it,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.530
then let's just skip the exam.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.330
We'll wait for Dr. Miyamoto.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.850
It's not too late to check later.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.290
I can't get through to you.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.850
I need to see the Colonel.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.770
Sorry to interrupt, I'm coming in.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.050
Where's the Colonel?

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.260
The Colonel already left.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.050
This isn't over!

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.770
I'm sorry.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.260
Completely useless!

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.460
Why didn't Sasaki show up at all?

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.090
Looks like your cover
won't last long.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.980
Even though Sasaki stayed hidden today,

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.020
judging by Takeda's reaction,

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.500
we probably made the right bet.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.500
Asking the Navy to step in

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.090
was just Takeda's own idea.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.180
Sasaki probably only just found out.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.570
So now, time's running out.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.290
Let's just stick with the original plan.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.810
We need a full-scale search.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.500
Stop right there. Inspection.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.850
What's going on today?

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.570
Why do you need to check us?

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.220
Ms. Xian.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.020
Captain Kobayashi.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.540
Colonel Sasaki personally promised me

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.850
that while Mr. Lee is in the hospital,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.650
I can visit him anytime.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.130
Today's a special day.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.220
Everyone needs to get checked.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.540
It's always better to be careful.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.900
All this is for everyone's safety.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.460
Please.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.610
Hey, what's up with you?

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.060
Thanks.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.570
You okay?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.610
After coming back last night,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.980
Takeda sent people

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.940
to stick to

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.060
me and Gu Yangshan.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.060
Gu Yangshan wanted
to go to the pharmacy

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.250
to steal chlorpheniramine
to pass the eye test,

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.730
but we never got the chance.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.060
Later, it hit me that

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.130
I was allergic to shrimp as a kid,

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.940
so I asked them for a plate of shrimp.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.690
After eating it,

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.770
sure enough, I broke out in a rash.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.860
The Japanese

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.130
were worried about my health,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.690
so they postponed my eye exam

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.980
to tomorrow.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.940
They prescribed me
tons of chlorpheniramine.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.770
I haven't taken a single pill.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.420
I'm saving them all.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.460
Even if tonight

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.900
our plan doesn't work out,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.090
it's still fine.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.980
With all these chlorpheniramine,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.210
I'll manage that exam tomorrow.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.820
Hopefully you won't need it.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:16.770
Ms. Xian,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.610
don't just keep staring at me.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.610
I know I look pretty bad right now,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.820
but it's nothing serious,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.980
just a little itchy, really.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.170
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.610
I won't be an eyesore for long.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:36.980
Stop scratching it.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.290
Or it could get infected.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.860
You should keep this safe.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.570
See you tonight then.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:55.980
Watch where you're going.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.770
Sorry about that.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.610
Are you blind?

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.460
Sorry.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.610
I'm really sorry.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.690
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.210
I'm truly sorry.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.540
Be careful when you walk.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.860
What took you so long?

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.610
Ding Yi and Takeda had a big fight.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.020
There are twice as many guards today.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.340
It'll take time to shake them off.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.860
Everything's ready now.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.020
We're just waiting for tonight.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.340
Let's sync our watches.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.880
[Safety Amulet]

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.540
These are photos
Matsumoto took recently.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.980
They meet almost every day.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.420
Unless they're exchanging intel,

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:37.500
there's no other explanation

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.770
for why they need to

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.250
meet this often.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.090
Mr. Takeda.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.540
KLX83?

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.170
That's their British merchant ship.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.130
It's leaving for
China Hong Kong tonight.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.020
The photos and maps

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.500
seem to connect all the dots.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.380
Looks like Joseph Lee

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.570
really plans to run.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.460
All those so-called attacks
and disappearances

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.460
were just excuses for failed escapes.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.610
This Joseph Lee

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.610
wants to get away.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.170
First, he linked up with the British,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.020
pretending to train our cipher talent.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.460
Then, he used Xian Biyun

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.570
to sell our intel to the British.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.060
Now he's done selling

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.170
and planned to sneak away
on a British merchant ship.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.610
It's not that easy.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.250
Alright.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.170
Tonight's the night.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.730
We'll catch them with everything.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.650
Just heard from someone,

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.610
Charlie stole a doctor's uniform
from the laundry,

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.900
clearly prepping
for the escape tonight.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.090
I've checked myself.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.130
There's loads of alcohol
stored in the pharmacy,

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.500
I'll find a way to set it alight.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.020
You run off during the chaos.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.980
I'll meet you at our spot.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:20.980
Tonight, at the hospital,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.500
only Matsumoto will be on guard.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.980
Let him know,

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.980
no matter what excuse
Joseph Lee gives,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.020
don't try to stop him.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:30.570
Mr. Takeda,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.980
isn't this a bit risky?

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.610
I don't have time to waste.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.130
To catch the prey,

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.770
we can make the trap inviting

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.770
and tighten the rope outside.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.090
Set our main team outside the hospital.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.380
Even if Joseph Lee

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.380
comes out from the sewer,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.570
someone must be on him right away.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.980
At the same time,

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.690
I'll secure the roads
from the hospital to the dock

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.250
all covered.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:11.020
Once he boards KLX83,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.900
and when the ship moves,

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.090
that's when we move in.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.380
As long as he gets on the ship

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.500
and meets up with Frank,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.460
we can hold them right away.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.980
Why wait for the ship to start?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.900
You know exactly what's going on.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.610
Joseph Lee is our honored guest.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:33.090
He met a few British friends.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.500
At most, it's a minor procedural slip.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.500
But if we catch him boarding

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.610
the British ship,

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.610
and the ship sails,
that's trying to run.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.170
Once it moves,

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.980
there's no way for us to stop it.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.460
Get in the car.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.980
Mr. Takeda,

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:15.650
look over there.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.170
They're making their move.
