00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.400
A'man.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.400
Don't touch me.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.040
A'man,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.680
wh-what's wrong?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.840
What did you do to me?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.360
What?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.120
I didn't do anything.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.880
A'man.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.320
A'man, wait for me.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
My lord, it's the blue whistle.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.352
It seems they found the groom
of Duting Station.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.504
I'll take men there now.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.840
When you arrive, evacuate him quickly.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.680
Understood.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.280
A'man.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.360
A'man.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.240
Don't touch me!

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.840
Did I hurt you?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.720
But

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.560
you're my concubine.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.160
Let me go.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.200
You're my woman.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.240
- You won't let me touch you.
- Don't come closer.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.520
Who do you want touching you?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000
Lu Shi'an, let me go!

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.440
Let me go!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.520
Why can't I touch you?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.440
Why can't I touch you?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.280
No!

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.600
For Jin's sake,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm begging you.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.080
I beg you, please.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.200
Let me go.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.560
A'man.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.560
I'm begging you.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.280
Forgive me.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.680
I beg you.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.560
I truly can't control myself.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.680
My lord,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.040
I never thought they'd fight

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.800
so desperately. I underestimated them.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
It's not your fault.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.480
The groom wasn't taken far.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.480
After them!

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.240
- Understood!
- Understood!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
They should catch up.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.240
Your hand...

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.880
It's fine.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.200
Handle the cleanup. I'll return first.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.760
Okay.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.520
(It's unbearable.
The drug's too strong.)

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200
(My whole body's burning up.)

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.120
A'man?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.680
A'man!

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.040
A'man.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560
A'man.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.080
(Shen Que.)

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.080
What's wrong?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.760
I...

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360
I can't. Stay back!

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.840
A'man. A'man!

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.480
Stay back.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.200
Stay back.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560
I just want to help you.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320
You've taken Heye Powder?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.200
Was it Lu Shi'an?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.240
Tell me.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.320
Was it Lu Shi'an? I'll kill him!

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.200
Don't go.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.880
Don't go.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.120
Don't go kill him.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.760
Don't go.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.560
Why?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.880
Don't go.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.720
I can't let anyone know I'm here.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.040
A'man,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880
let's find a physician,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.040
okay?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.440
A'man, I'll find a physician.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.360
Wait here. You'll be fine.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.040
Don't leave.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.880
This can't get out.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.960
A'man! A'man!

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.320
Are you insane?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.240
Soak in cold water for an hour.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.800
It'll neutralize the drug.

Lu Shi'an. Lu Shi'an!

My lord,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.880
does the Inner Bureau also meddle
in my bed affairs with a concubine?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.520
You drugged and violated her.
I can charge you for this.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.480
I didn't drug her!
Someone tampered with it!

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.920
You can investigate freely.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.080
But when the time comes,
let everyone hear

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.600
whether I'm truly guilty,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.080
or Ye Qinglan and you
are illicitly involved.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.400
What?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.160
Why don't you explain?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.040
Getting nervous?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.400
Let me make this clear.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.680
I spare your life

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.640
because you're Jin's father,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.120
and you once took in Ye Qinglan.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.400
For that kindness,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.080
I'm grateful.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.000
But if you dare
harm her again in any way,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.800
I won't hesitate
to wipe out the Lu family.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.120
Understood?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.040
Did I hurt you?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.760
I'm sorry. I came late.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.600
It was not your fault.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.640
I never expected Lu Shi'an
to drug me either.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920
Your hand is injured.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.040
It's nothing.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.920
Just an accident last night.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.320
H-Have I caused any trouble?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.080
A'man,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.760
come back to me,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.240
okay?

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.280
I don't want it to happen again.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.320
I'm just a criminal slave,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.400
and a woman who

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.800
bore another man's child.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.560
You're different.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.200
You are an official.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.040
A noble person

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.120
with power and status,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.320
yet to be married.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.640
I don't want you to waste

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.800
all your time

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.600
and energy on me.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.200
I can take care of myself.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.400
A'man, we're close to the truth.

00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:27.232
We're investigating those
who worked in Duting Station.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400
Once we find the culprit,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.160
we can clear your family's name.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.840
I thank you on behalf
of my father and brother.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.640
Since when do we need to say thanks?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.880
You're being too distant with me.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.560

Lu Shi'an last night?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.240

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.360
So

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.520
you didn't...

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.320
Didn't what?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.760
Nothing.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.720

(old grudges would melt away.)

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.440
I never expected it to be her.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.600
You wouldn't understand women's matters.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120
I truly don't understand.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.960
But as long as she doesn't harm you,
I won't interfere.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.760
Could you find me some clean clothes?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.240
Why?

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.320
To go back.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.480
Ye Qinglan, you're truly obstinate.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I'll go with you.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160
But not now.
