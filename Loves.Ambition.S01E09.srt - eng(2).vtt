00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:45.333
First, let's turn to

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.853
the latest on global markets.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:49.773
(Host, Xu Yan)
Renewed confidence

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.732
fueled a global market rally yesterday.

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:53.853
(Nasdaq hits all-time high)
The Nasdaq index,

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:55.372
fueled by tech giants,

00:01:55.413 --> 00:01:56.853
has surged to a new record high,

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.693
climbing over 1 percent.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.053
I think

00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:03.812
delivering it in a steadier pace

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:04.532
is better.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:05.773
I don't agree.

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:07.053
I think it's great.

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:09.733
Moreover,

00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:10.773
this suits her better

00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:12.053
than food programs.

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:17.893
Yan.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:23.972
A surprise for you.

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:26.493
Want to know?

00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:31.252
We two

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.453
have been thinking about

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:36.453
giving you a special gift.

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:37.072
Here.

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:38.293
Congratulations!

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:40.613
Thank you, Mom, Dad.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:42.053
Open it and check.

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:47.692
This is too expensive.

00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:48.933
Do you like it?

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:50.933
I'm glad you like it.

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:53.812
Thank you.

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.293
Both of us think

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.213
now that you're an anchor,

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:03.652
your on-screen presence

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:05.053
should be more elegant.

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:06.252
Rubies are perfect.

00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:10.333
Let me put them on you.

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:12.572
You're always thoughtful.

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:14.493
I'd only know

00:03:14.532 --> 00:03:15.173
to buy bags,

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:16.773
which are useless here.

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:18.652
If you think in this way,

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:19.933
you must strive to

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:22.013
keep your wife satisfied.

00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:23.733
Right?

00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:24.372
Right.

00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:25.173
Haoming.

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:26.532
Haoming.

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:28.272
I'll switch horses next Saturday.

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.264
Can you go with me?

00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:30.613
Saturday?

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:31.812
Not Saturday.

00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:32.933
He and I

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.053
have a meeting with Mr. Wu.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:35.132
Fine.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.412
I'm not important.

00:03:40.372 --> 00:03:40.852
Haochen.

00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:44.572
Maybe I'll go with you.

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:46.333
Do you know about horse switching?

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:47.453
This kid...

00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:49.213
Alright.

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:51.692
Forget it.

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:54.412
Let me try these earrings on you.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:03:58.013
Catch!

00:03:58.173 --> 00:03:58.692
Go!

00:03:58.692 --> 00:03:59.092
Pass it!

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:06.213
- Stop fighting!
- Stop!

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.213
Stop it!

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:07.972
Bu!

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:10.412
Throw it farther.

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:13.053
Bu.

00:04:13.372 --> 00:04:13.893
Bu.

00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:15.333
Bu, come.

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:16.372
Come.

00:04:17.372 --> 00:04:17.692
Come.

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:19.933
(Parents' Group)

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.053
What happened?

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.252
So annoying.

00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:23.173
Ready, Bu?

00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:25.613
Trouble again.

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:26.093
Mr. Wang.

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:31.212
What's up, Mom?

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:33.613
Haochen's teacher texted me.

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:35.252
He hit a classmate again

00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:36.252
during P.E. class.

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:37.493
Not his first offense.

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:39.312
His parents insist me to go.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.272
I'm so busy!

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:42.173
Hosting ten feasts

00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:43.692
is easier than dealing

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:44.892
with his teacher's message.

00:04:45.332 --> 00:04:47.173
Haochen always causes trouble.

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:48.252
I'd be lectured

00:04:48.252 --> 00:04:50.012
by these young teachers.

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:51.892
We are all busy.

00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:52.812
And I have

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:53.692
to handle these.

00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:55.533
I'm overwhelmed. This is annoying.

00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.173
Every time the teacher calls,

00:04:57.212 --> 00:04:58.053
my heart aches.

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:03.973
You're more patient than I am.

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:06.252
I'll add you to the group,

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:07.093
and I'll exit.

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:08.733
Deal then.

00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:10.692
Is it okay, Mom?

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:11.533
It's perfectly okay.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:12.733
You married Haoming,

00:05:12.772 --> 00:05:13.653
and we are family now.

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.173
You are also Haochen's guardian.

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:16.293
Deal then.

00:05:16.572 --> 00:05:17.572
I'll tell his teacher.

00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:20.212
Okay.

00:05:23.452 --> 00:05:24.132
But, Mom.

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:26.212
It's my first time being a parent.

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.572
There's much I don't understand.

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:28.653
Please guide me.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:30.653
No need. Just follow instructions.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.892
Apologize when needed. Alright.

00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:34.533
I've added you.

00:05:35.372 --> 00:05:35.812
(Parents' Group)
I'm in.

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:39.812
(You've joined this group chat.)

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:40.452
The teacher...

00:05:40.493 --> 00:05:41.173
Bu!

00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:41.973
Bu, come.

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:42.892
I will play with you.

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:44.733
Here.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:45.733
Babe.

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.252
Come here. Come.

Understood.

I'll talk to him when we get home.

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:10.252
Sorry, we'll take the blame.

00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.012
When you get home, talk it out with him.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:14.093
As his family,

00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:15.812
you can't just dump him at school

00:06:15.933 --> 00:06:17.012
and leave him alone.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.093
This doesn't work.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:20.533
Understood.

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:21.812
After we go back,

00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:23.053
I'll talk to him.

00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:23.772
Alright.

00:06:24.012 --> 00:06:24.653
That's it.

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:25.572
Thank you.

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:26.480
Goodbye.

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:36.533
Okay.

00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:37.653
Next one.

00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:40.452
Move to the center.

00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:42.653
Next one.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:03.533
Want to tell me

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:04.892
what happened today?

00:07:12.252 --> 00:07:13.252
Don't worry.

00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:15.053
The kid's parents

00:07:15.093 --> 00:07:16.533
won't pursue it further.

00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:18.173
But I think

00:07:19.332 --> 00:07:20.653
we need to talk it out.

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:28.692
Can you hear me?

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:42.012
Back?

00:07:44.613 --> 00:07:45.772
Yan, how was it?

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:49.012
The kid's parents
won't pursue it further.

00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:54.053
He really needs to control his temper.

00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:54.973
He's only twelve.

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:56.080
When he's older,

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.136
we can't control him.

00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:59.452
What we're providing him with

00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:00.853
the best educational resources.

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:01.812
An excellent school.

00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:02.653
Right?

00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:04.332
Now we need

00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:05.212
to focus on

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:07.533
solving the problem.

00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:10.772
Maybe we should consider

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:12.093
sending him abroad.

00:08:17.053 --> 00:08:17.493
Mom.

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:19.772
Haochen is only twelve.

00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:21.613
Isn't it too early for him?

00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:23.053
Ms. Sun's child

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:24.452
went abroad even younger than him.

00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:25.933
Went to Australia at eight.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.933
Wait, this varies case by case.

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:29.332
He just turned twelve.

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:30.413
If we send him abroad now,

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:31.493
he might

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:32.373
go astray,

00:08:32.492 --> 00:08:33.612
and no one will

00:08:33.653 --> 00:08:34.572
correct him then.

00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:35.893
But he's a boy.

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:37.253
He could benefit from it.

00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:38.533
I don't oppose it.

00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:39.492
But we must

00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:40.612
find the right timing.

00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:41.893
It varies case by case.

00:08:42.092 --> 00:08:43.053
Maybe it works

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:44.053
for other kids,

00:08:44.092 --> 00:08:44.812
but not ours.

00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:46.933
Listen, he's been spoiled...

00:08:55.612 --> 00:08:57.212
The school isn't over yet.

00:08:59.092 --> 00:08:59.773
I'll go check.

00:09:10.253 --> 00:09:11.092
I think we should

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:12.253
discuss this with him.

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:14.612
Let's hear what Haochen thinks.

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:16.332
If he rejects,

00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:17.013
don't force him.

00:09:17.612 --> 00:09:18.013
Haoming.

00:09:18.972 --> 00:09:19.893
In this entire family,

00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:21.373
you spoil him the most.

00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:22.653
You take the blame

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.812
for turning him this way.

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:26.173
Reflect on this.

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:33.773
Haochen.

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:45.092
I think

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.013
the school isn't over yet.

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:47.972
Why you...?

00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:48.773
Let me ask you.

00:09:50.972 --> 00:09:52.492
Did you tell my parents

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:53.732
to send me abroad?

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:57.812
Why would I do that?

00:10:00.053 --> 00:10:01.653
Stop pretending.

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:04.173
You made my brother fall for you,

00:10:04.373 --> 00:10:05.612
and then pleased my parents,

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:07.212
until everyone adored you.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.452
But I didn't fall for your tricks.

00:10:09.732 --> 00:10:10.852
Now trying to drive me away?

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:11.972
- Right?
- Right.

00:10:15.413 --> 00:10:16.852
You guessed it right.

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:20.293
I do want to drive you away.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.413
And then

00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:22.572
make them all adore me.

00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:24.373
How clever of me!

00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:26.612
Shen Haochen.

00:10:27.173 --> 00:10:28.692
Use that little brain of yours.

00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:30.133
Does this make any sense?

00:10:32.253 --> 00:10:32.933
Let me tell you.

00:10:32.972 --> 00:10:34.212
I'm not going abroad.

00:10:34.332 --> 00:10:35.812
No matter what tricks you pull,

00:10:36.013 --> 00:10:36.972
I, Shen Haochen,

00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:38.212
fight you to the end.

00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:39.092
I don't know why

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:40.293
you're so hostile toward me,

00:10:40.893 --> 00:10:41.773
but let me remind you,

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:43.413
I married your brother.

00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:45.293
I'm your sister-in-law,
and we're family now.

00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:46.933
I love you

00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:48.013
how much they love you.

00:10:48.133 --> 00:10:49.173
I won't hurt you,

00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:50.572
so I don't need

00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:51.413
to send you abroad.

00:10:51.893 --> 00:10:53.092
Before you came,

00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:54.812
my brother spent every day with me.

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.253
If you listen to me,

00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:07.133
and no more

00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:08.492
of today's incident,

00:11:09.413 --> 00:11:10.173
I can make

00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:12.173
Haoming spend more time with you.

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:13.972
I can guarantee

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:16.053
you would stay.

00:11:16.972 --> 00:11:17.572
Deal?

00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:20.773
What's this new trick?

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.692
We're in an advantageous position.

00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:31.092
Have some tea.

00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:36.293
What does this mean?

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:38.293
Jinda Group has agreed

00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:39.972
to grant us exclusive coverage

00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:42.332
of the New District development project.

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:45.013
This is an extraordinary opportunity!

00:11:45.852 --> 00:11:47.893
Many media outlets are vying for this.

00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.092
And you're the perfect candidate
for this.

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:54.413
I'm telling you.

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:56.212
Once this project launches,

00:11:56.812 --> 00:11:58.413
it'll boost your career.

00:12:01.492 --> 00:12:01.893
Of course,

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:04.133
your professional skills are excellent.

00:12:04.692 --> 00:12:06.053
But this will

00:12:06.373 --> 00:12:07.612
be the icing on the cake.

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:10.133
Thank you, Sir.

00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:11.452
Not at all.

00:12:11.692 --> 00:12:12.612
Come on. Have some tea.

00:12:18.773 --> 00:12:19.344
Yan.

00:12:22.692 --> 00:12:23.692
There's a Mr. Zhou

00:12:23.732 --> 00:12:25.332
waiting for you downstairs.

00:12:28.972 --> 00:12:29.572
Okay.

00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:35.293
It's been so long.

00:12:35.452 --> 00:12:37.933
Five or six years, I think?

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:39.568
How are you?

00:12:41.373 --> 00:12:42.053
Not bad.

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:44.173
Seeing you on TV

00:12:44.452 --> 00:12:45.812
after all these years,

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:47.253
you've fulfilled your dream

00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:48.452
of becoming a news anchor.

00:12:48.812 --> 00:12:49.692
I'm happy for you.

00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:51.053
Thank you.

00:12:55.893 --> 00:12:56.692
Remember?

00:12:57.373 --> 00:12:58.293
Our first meeting

00:12:58.332 --> 00:12:59.253
was also in a cafe.

00:13:01.136 --> 00:13:01.852
(Five Years Ago)

00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:03.092
Zhou, your project

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:05.133
is too theoretical for me.

00:13:05.653 --> 00:13:06.173
Mr. Chen,

00:13:06.373 --> 00:13:07.253
there are

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:07.972
very few experts

00:13:08.048 --> 00:13:09.136
involved in this research

00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:10.533
and not many people understand

00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:11.452
its systems.

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:13.332
I believe in the upcoming future,

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:14.092
it will become

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.653
the prevailing trend in healthcare

00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:18.133
and empower doctors
to better serve patients.

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:18.812
Alright.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.533
I understand your point.

00:13:21.013 --> 00:13:22.173
Let's stop here for today.

00:13:22.373 --> 00:13:23.253
I have a meeting soon.

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:24.773
I'll consider it.

00:13:25.293 --> 00:13:25.893
Fine.

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:26.852
Call me.

00:13:29.692 --> 00:13:30.212
Mr. Chen,

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:31.212
the proposal.

00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:31.852
No need.

00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:36.253
Xu Yan.

00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:39.373
I've reviewed your resume, impressive.

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:41.173
Finished the form?

00:13:41.972 --> 00:13:42.492
Yes.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.612
Here you go. Please.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:50.732
The family members
and occupations section

00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:52.092
is left blank here.

00:13:52.253 --> 00:13:53.133
Why?

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.332
May I ask

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:04.812
this section is mandatory?

00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:06.812
This top-tier media company

00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:09.013
puts great emphasis
on employees' backgrounds.

00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:11.133
Beyond education
and professional skills,

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:12.533
family background serves as

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.253
a part of background checks.

00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:16.653
Understood.

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:20.773
I grew up with my grandma.

00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:23.612
Then I'll...

00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:25.212
May I ask

00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:26.692
about your parents' occupations?

00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:32.133
My family runs a barbershop.

00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:34.053
Include that?

00:14:34.092 --> 00:14:35.133
Then better not.

00:14:35.533 --> 00:14:37.492
This could get you a bonus,

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:38.533
but filling it in

00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:39.373
will be unfavorable.

00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:42.933
But you can't leave it blank.

00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:45.133
Here's my suggestion.

00:14:45.492 --> 00:14:46.933
Overseas business operations.

00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:47.933
Don't worry.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:48.852
They usually

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.053
can't verify this.

00:14:50.492 --> 00:14:51.212
It's safer.

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:53.013
I advise you not to listen to her.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:54.653
Fabricating resumes

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.653
is equivalent to planting

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.133
a time bomb in your career.

00:14:58.173 --> 00:14:58.692
One day,

00:14:58.692 --> 00:14:59.773
it would suddenly explode.

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:01.413
Then all your credibility

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:02.653
and your previous efforts

00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:04.533
would be completely wasted.

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:06.092
These despicable headhunters

00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:06.893
are increasing.

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:08.972
What if they use this to threaten you?

00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:09.653
Nonsense.

00:15:11.013 --> 00:15:12.053
Miss.

00:15:12.173 --> 00:15:13.293
You're eavesdropping us,

00:15:13.692 --> 00:15:14.773
and now slandering me?

00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:19.332
Just fill it in here.

00:15:24.612 --> 00:15:25.533
- Here?
- Right.

00:15:27.536 --> 00:15:29.264
(Family Members)

00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:40.212
Miss.

00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:42.373
I just graduated.

00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:44.572
I want to be honest.

00:15:45.572 --> 00:15:46.653
If it's really

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.533
as he said...

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:49.933
Then I can't handle

00:15:49.972 --> 00:15:50.773
this case for you.

00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:51.332
Okay?

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:53.173
I won't take the commission.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.492
- Miss.
- Can't believe it.

00:16:14.332 --> 00:16:14.893
Sorry.

00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:15.653
No problem.

00:16:16.972 --> 00:16:18.533
Hello. I'm Xu Yan.

00:16:19.053 --> 00:16:21.053
I submitted my resume to your company.

00:16:21.092 --> 00:16:22.293
Sorry, we're not interested.

00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:23.812
Wait. Please hear me out.

00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:33.692
For you.

00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:37.773
You failed today,

00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:39.133
but don't be discouraged.

00:16:39.413 --> 00:16:40.773
Just like this sunflower,

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.533
thrive strongly and never give up.

00:16:45.732 --> 00:16:46.253
Thank you.

00:16:47.332 --> 00:16:47.812
Excuse me.

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:50.653
Hello.

00:16:53.572 --> 00:16:54.013
Okay.

00:16:58.212 --> 00:16:58.852
Excuse me.

00:16:59.612 --> 00:17:00.692
Now I need one too.

00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:02.612
The investor

00:17:02.732 --> 00:17:03.173
won't come.

00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:08.252
Alright.

00:17:08.853 --> 00:17:09.532
Then let's

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.373
thrive strongly together.

00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:12.413
Keep going!

00:17:15.772 --> 00:17:16.653
I-I want to ask

00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:17.573
if you made this

00:17:17.573 --> 00:17:18.813
from that proposal.

00:17:18.972 --> 00:17:19.452
Exactly.

00:17:19.492 --> 00:17:20.212
No one wants it.

00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:21.373
Need this resume?

00:17:21.532 --> 00:17:22.373
I can teach you.

00:17:22.413 --> 00:17:23.052
No, thanks.

00:17:25.093 --> 00:17:25.813
What's your name?

00:17:26.292 --> 00:17:26.972
I'm Zhou Zeyuan.

00:17:27.252 --> 00:17:27.692
And you?

00:17:28.052 --> 00:17:28.813
I'm Xu Yan.

00:17:29.052 --> 00:17:29.532
Xu Yan.

00:17:30.173 --> 00:17:31.452
Now you've become

00:17:31.532 --> 00:17:32.853
a genuinely successful woman.

00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:35.133
Not really.

00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:38.252
I just became a news anchor recently,

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.173
still waiting to see audience feedback.

00:17:40.653 --> 00:17:41.933
It's too early to say so.

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:44.212
Enough about me.

00:17:44.492 --> 00:17:45.732
What about you? What do you do?

00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:48.052
Those investors

00:17:48.093 --> 00:17:48.972
all doubted me,

00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:50.492
but I always believed in myself.

00:17:51.728 --> 00:17:53.933
When my company started,
there were only three.

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:55.573
And now we have

00:17:55.613 --> 00:17:56.732
over 160 people

00:17:56.772 --> 00:17:57.424
in the company.

00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:59.052
We got three funding rounds,

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:00.292
and expanded

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:01.732
from domestic to overseas markets.

00:18:01.813 --> 00:18:02.732
We established branches

00:18:02.893 --> 00:18:03.972
in New York, London,

00:18:04.052 --> 00:18:04.893
and Ottawa.

00:18:05.373 --> 00:18:05.853
Mr. Zhou.

00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:09.212
And we signed a contract

00:18:09.252 --> 00:18:10.532
with a German institution.

00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:12.653
My plan is to collaborate with

00:18:12.653 --> 00:18:13.653
over 70 hospitals

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:14.613
in three years.

00:18:14.613 --> 00:18:15.692
(He is radiant with vigor,)

00:18:15.893 --> 00:18:17.252
(and full of ambitious spirit,)

00:18:17.772 --> 00:18:18.853
(just like he was)

00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:19.772
(when we first met.)

00:18:20.692 --> 00:18:21.732
(The only difference)

00:18:22.292 --> 00:18:23.933
(might be his current outfit.)

00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:25.972
(It looks casual,)

00:18:26.413 --> 00:18:27.613
(without flashy logos,)

00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:29.972
(yet clearly expensive at first glance,)

00:18:30.653 --> 00:18:32.333
(perfectly embodying the image)

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:33.772
(of a tech nouveau riche here.)

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.133
Moreover, I plan

00:18:35.173 --> 00:18:36.373
to go public on NASDAQ

00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:37.452
by next year's end.

00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:41.052
- Have some water.
- Thanks.

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.012
When we first met,

00:18:44.173 --> 00:18:46.252
we were all novices.

00:18:46.613 --> 00:18:48.012
Now look at us.

00:18:49.732 --> 00:18:51.813
I've believed
in the mysticism of persistence.

00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:53.452
Persistence will get rewards.

00:18:53.573 --> 00:18:55.333
We achieve what we're determined to do.

00:18:59.052 --> 00:18:59.613
Xu Yan,

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.133
I know you married

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.413
Shen Haoming from Jinda Group.

00:19:02.692 --> 00:19:04.012
Jinda Group is top-tier

00:19:04.052 --> 00:19:05.093
in the construction field.

00:19:05.492 --> 00:19:07.133
Their Investment Division

00:19:07.173 --> 00:19:08.573
is also highly reputable.

00:19:09.613 --> 00:19:10.692
Given our relationship,

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:12.173
I'll be direct.

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:13.373
To be honest,

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:15.452
I came to you

00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:16.653
to connect through you

00:19:16.972 --> 00:19:17.772
with your husband.

00:19:18.413 --> 00:19:20.573
Collaborating with Jinda Group

00:19:20.772 --> 00:19:21.853
would benefit

00:19:22.093 --> 00:19:23.212
my company greatly.

00:19:29.212 --> 00:19:31.093
I deeply respect the industry

00:19:31.492 --> 00:19:32.732
and vision you've chosen.

00:19:34.893 --> 00:19:35.333
By the way,

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.012
could you first send me

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:38.732
your company's

00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:39.853
recent financial reports

00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:40.732
and business plans?

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.212
Then I'll tell my husband.

00:19:43.093 --> 00:19:44.933
No problem. I'll prepare it right away.

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:47.093
Thank you for your support.

00:19:47.573 --> 00:19:48.613
Not really.

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:50.813
A worthwhile investment project

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:52.613
can be beneficial, for my husband

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.212
and the group.

00:19:54.653 --> 00:19:55.813
A win-win situation

00:19:56.972 --> 00:19:57.613
would be ideal.

00:20:00.452 --> 00:20:00.853
Mr. Zhou.

00:20:01.173 --> 00:20:02.333
Mr. Wang from Youkang Medical

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.173
is here again.

00:20:03.813 --> 00:20:04.333
We agreed...

00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:07.012
Zhou.

00:20:08.012 --> 00:20:08.452
Zhou.

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:09.732
I've tried to schedule you,

00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:10.772
but failed.

00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:12.560
Reserve this batch of equipment for me.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.456
The price is flexible.

00:20:13.456 --> 00:20:15.613
Let's sign the contract today.

00:20:15.653 --> 00:20:16.080
No, no.

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:16.976
Wang.

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:18.093
I've been so busy lately.

00:20:18.212 --> 00:20:19.813
And I have a guest here today.

00:20:20.212 --> 00:20:20.813
Another day.

00:20:21.052 --> 00:20:21.413
Fine.

00:20:21.732 --> 00:20:23.212
You go ahead. I'll wait here.

00:20:25.373 --> 00:20:25.972
Then sorry.

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:26.813
Please wait here.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.653
Wang, come with me.

00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:31.012
Listen, I've tried to schedule you.

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:32.252
I've been overwhelmed.

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:32.732
Let's go.

00:20:35.312 --> 00:20:36.976
(New Medical Innovation Competition,
First Prize)

00:20:45.893 --> 00:20:46.532
Excuse me.

00:20:46.853 --> 00:20:47.692
Where's the restroom?

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:49.452
Go straight and turn left.

00:20:49.653 --> 00:20:50.333
Okay, thank you.

00:20:58.893 --> 00:21:00.012
I haven't had my break yet.

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:01.333
Yes.

00:21:01.653 --> 00:21:03.252
My current job is super easy.

00:21:03.732 --> 00:21:05.212
Just sit there doing nothing.

00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:06.452
Five hundred a day.

00:21:06.893 --> 00:21:08.252
Much easier than the filming work.

00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:09.933
Want to join me?

00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:11.732
Let's come together.

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:14.573
Don't worry. No one notices you.

00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:16.532
Just sit at the desk

00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:17.692
and pretend to work.

00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:19.853
Exactly.

00:21:21.252 --> 00:21:22.573
It's just a shell company.

00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:23.813
Doesn't matter.

00:21:24.173 --> 00:21:25.252
They don't need skills.

00:21:38.653 --> 00:21:40.052
Can you show me?

00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:44.492
Of course.

00:21:46.532 --> 00:21:47.532
I-It's simple.

00:21:51.333 --> 00:21:52.133
Under maintenance.

00:21:52.173 --> 00:21:53.853
Let me find Mr. Wang
over in Engineering.

00:22:01.532 --> 00:22:02.292
Hello.

00:22:02.492 --> 00:22:05.173
This is Shangze Xinhui
Medical Technology.

00:22:06.252 --> 00:22:09.692
Hello. This is Shangze Xinhui
Medical Technology.

00:22:10.252 --> 00:22:12.012
We've completed

00:22:12.052 --> 00:22:13.813
comprehensive upgrades.

00:22:14.532 --> 00:22:15.972
Rest assured about our services.

00:22:16.413 --> 00:22:18.413
Our services are lifelong.

00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:26.492
For any problem,

00:22:26.532 --> 00:22:28.492
feel free to contact us anytime.

00:22:31.173 --> 00:22:31.613
Liang.

00:22:32.212 --> 00:22:33.452
About the financial report,

00:22:33.492 --> 00:22:34.492
the CFO wants to see you.

00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:35.413
What?

00:22:36.252 --> 00:22:37.452
A payment from the 15th

00:22:37.492 --> 00:22:38.413
needs verification.

00:22:38.452 --> 00:22:39.853
A payment on the 15th?

00:22:50.608 --> 00:22:52.976
(Sales Department Archives)

00:23:12.252 --> 00:23:12.772
Xu Yan.

00:23:15.613 --> 00:23:16.492
Sorry to let you wait.

00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:17.413
Mr. Wang left.

00:23:17.492 --> 00:23:18.573
Let's talk then.

00:23:21.012 --> 00:23:21.772
I didn't tell you

00:23:21.813 --> 00:23:22.772
I have plans tonight.

00:23:24.252 --> 00:23:24.692
It's okay.

00:23:25.532 --> 00:23:26.212
Call me.

00:23:26.373 --> 00:23:26.653
Okay.

00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:03.212
Honey, are you done?

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:04.093
Almost.

00:24:10.972 --> 00:24:11.532
By the way,

00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:13.212
is cousin still in Jingzhou?

00:24:16.853 --> 00:24:17.653
Probably.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.052
She found a job?

00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:25.813
Selling cosmetics.

00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:28.613
Thank you.

00:24:30.813 --> 00:24:31.893
Let's treat her to a meal.

00:24:36.732 --> 00:24:37.373
Okay.

00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:39.252
However,

00:24:39.893 --> 00:24:41.373
she's working at a mall now.

00:24:42.012 --> 00:24:43.212
She might get off work late.

00:24:45.012 --> 00:24:45.573
It's okay.

00:24:46.052 --> 00:24:46.573
Let her know

00:24:46.972 --> 00:24:49.052
I'll adjust to her schedule

00:24:49.413 --> 00:24:50.413
to show my sincerity.

00:24:51.772 --> 00:24:52.373
No problem.

00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:53.653
I'll tell her.

00:24:57.532 --> 00:24:58.292
Delicious.

00:25:10.452 --> 00:25:11.133
This way, please.

00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:15.093
So many koi fish here.

00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:19.692
Mind your words.

00:25:20.573 --> 00:25:21.133
Okay, okay.

00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:30.373
I've ordered some dishes.

00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:32.653
Let's see what else you'd like.

00:25:32.893 --> 00:25:34.212
I eat anything. Thank you.

00:25:35.532 --> 00:25:36.413
Any vegetable?

00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:38.373
Golden mushroom shreds,

00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:39.452
chrysanthemum moss,

00:25:39.732 --> 00:25:40.692
baby bok choy,

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:41.692
braised shallots,

00:25:41.813 --> 00:25:42.933
red peppers in sauce,

00:25:43.093 --> 00:25:44.052
counterfeit dish,

00:25:44.093 --> 00:25:45.692
and our signature stir-fry.

00:25:51.972 --> 00:25:52.413
Cousin,

00:25:53.692 --> 00:25:54.452
what do you want?

00:25:56.813 --> 00:25:57.692
I... I...

00:25:57.853 --> 00:25:59.093
Anything will do.

00:25:59.373 --> 00:26:01.532
Well, any spinach?

00:26:02.373 --> 00:26:03.333
Sorry, miss.

00:26:03.573 --> 00:26:05.133
We don't have a fixed menu here.

00:26:05.452 --> 00:26:06.853
Our menu changes daily based on

00:26:06.893 --> 00:26:09.333
the freshest seasonal ingredients
available at the market.

00:26:10.052 --> 00:26:11.573
Therefore, you can only order dishes

00:26:11.772 --> 00:26:12.292
on the menu.

00:26:14.212 --> 00:26:14.813
How about...?

00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:17.732
She prefers spinach.

00:26:18.373 --> 00:26:19.093
Go get some.

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:19.853
Thank you.

00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:20.573
Yes, Mr. Shen.

00:26:21.093 --> 00:26:21.732
Thank you.

00:26:22.212 --> 00:26:22.933
Welcome.

00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:23.532
Here.

00:26:24.613 --> 00:26:24.933
Here.

00:26:25.452 --> 00:26:26.292
Welcome to Jingzhou.

00:26:26.532 --> 00:26:27.012
Thank you.

00:26:33.772 --> 00:26:35.492
Are you settling in well here?

00:26:35.933 --> 00:26:36.492
Very well.

00:26:36.853 --> 00:26:38.173
Both the food and accommodations.

00:26:39.012 --> 00:26:41.173
If you need any help,

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.093
tell me anytime.

00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:43.813
I should be able to help.

00:26:44.373 --> 00:26:45.093
No need.

00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:46.012
Yan has been

00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:47.133
caring for me.

00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:47.933
My life now

00:26:47.972 --> 00:26:48.972
is back on track.

00:26:49.653 --> 00:26:50.452
Yan told me

00:26:50.492 --> 00:26:51.492
you're busy with work.

00:26:51.573 --> 00:26:52.972
Running such a large company,

00:26:53.173 --> 00:26:54.292
I shouldn't bother you.

00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:55.292
We're family.

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:56.093
It's okay.

00:27:03.893 --> 00:27:05.133
You mentioned liking this dish,

00:27:05.813 --> 00:27:06.573
so I reserved it.

00:27:07.732 --> 00:27:08.853
I just mentioned it,

00:27:09.093 --> 00:27:10.093
yet you remembered.

00:27:10.452 --> 00:27:11.012
Try it?

00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:11.972
No, you have it.

00:27:12.532 --> 00:27:13.893
I'm glad to see you two like this.

00:27:14.373 --> 00:27:15.933
Yan always

00:27:16.173 --> 00:27:18.133
praises you to me,

00:27:18.292 --> 00:27:19.893
saying you treat her so well.

00:27:20.212 --> 00:27:21.732
Witnessing it with my own eyes today,

00:27:21.933 --> 00:27:22.653
it's wonderful.

00:27:28.853 --> 00:27:29.413
Thank you.

00:27:30.613 --> 00:27:31.093
Cousin,

00:27:31.532 --> 00:27:32.532
tell me more.

00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:34.173
What else did she say about me?

00:27:36.653 --> 00:27:37.893
She loves you deeply.

00:27:39.212 --> 00:27:40.893
Yan had always been top of her class.

00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:42.012
She studied hard,

00:27:42.173 --> 00:27:43.173
excelled in academic.

00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:44.093
And she's pretty.

00:27:44.373 --> 00:27:45.333
Back in school,

00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:46.212
she's a top student

00:27:46.252 --> 00:27:47.333
and the campus belle.

00:27:47.692 --> 00:27:49.333
Many boys wanted to pursue her.

00:27:49.893 --> 00:27:50.813
But Yan

00:27:50.853 --> 00:27:51.653
was only focused on

00:27:51.653 --> 00:27:52.413
her studies

00:27:52.452 --> 00:27:53.212
and ignored boys.

00:27:53.813 --> 00:27:54.772
I used to wonder,

00:27:54.813 --> 00:27:55.413
she is

00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:56.772
with such high standards,

00:27:56.893 --> 00:27:58.452
who could possibly win her heart?

00:27:59.052 --> 00:27:59.893
You're so lucky.

00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:01.252
You are her first love.

00:28:06.613 --> 00:28:07.373
Really.

00:28:07.613 --> 00:28:08.853
When we were in school,

00:28:09.012 --> 00:28:10.532
she had zero interest in dating.

00:28:10.692 --> 00:28:11.492
To her,

00:28:11.532 --> 00:28:12.732
boys basically didn't exist.

00:28:12.853 --> 00:28:14.133
If the town had a girls' school,

00:28:14.252 --> 00:28:15.813
she would've transferred there.

00:28:18.012 --> 00:28:18.853
Were you two

00:28:18.893 --> 00:28:19.893
studying together?

00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:22.532
I remember Yan told me

00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:25.413
your hometown is Jincheng, Shanxi.

00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:36.492
Well...

00:28:36.732 --> 00:28:37.413
Good memory!

00:28:39.452 --> 00:28:39.972
Yes.

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:40.813
I...

00:28:42.173 --> 00:28:44.532
I wasn't good at studying.

00:28:44.573 --> 00:28:45.544
In high school,

00:28:45.544 --> 00:28:46.384
I repeated two grades

00:28:46.384 --> 00:28:47.212
and transferred to

00:28:47.252 --> 00:28:48.653
Yan's school

00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:50.732
for remedial classes.

00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:52.093
So we ended up studying together.

00:28:55.413 --> 00:28:55.813
Excuse me,

00:28:55.933 --> 00:28:56.653
allow me to serve.

00:28:58.692 --> 00:28:59.933
She's exactly the same.

00:29:00.012 --> 00:29:01.413
Back in school,

00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:03.373
she'd always interrupt the teachers.

00:29:03.573 --> 00:29:04.573
She still does it now.

00:29:05.492 --> 00:29:06.653
Try the spinach.

00:29:07.653 --> 00:29:08.093
Here.

00:29:08.373 --> 00:29:08.972
Don't be shy.

00:29:10.893 --> 00:29:11.732
We should

00:29:11.732 --> 00:29:12.573
meet up more often.

00:29:12.933 --> 00:29:14.012
I really enjoy hearing you

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:15.012
talk about Yan's past.

00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:16.373
Sure, no problem.

00:29:19.173 --> 00:29:20.813
(Mind your words.)

00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:21.653
But I'm busy.

00:29:22.972 --> 00:29:23.972
You two just go dating.

00:29:24.093 --> 00:29:24.972
I'm glad that you two

00:29:25.012 --> 00:29:25.772
get along well.

00:29:28.813 --> 00:29:29.853
Here, have some more.

00:29:33.373 --> 00:29:34.173
Yan isn't the type

00:29:34.853 --> 00:29:36.133
to fall for anyone easily.

00:29:36.813 --> 00:29:38.173
But once she does,

00:29:38.933 --> 00:29:40.012
it's for a lifetime.

00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:44.772
You better cherish her, okay?

00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:49.373
Don't worry.

00:29:50.093 --> 00:29:50.653
I will.

00:29:51.813 --> 00:29:52.333
Good.

00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:00.613
Here.

00:30:09.853 --> 00:30:10.492
By the way,

00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:12.212
any plans after the meal?

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:16.452
There is

00:30:16.933 --> 00:30:18.012
a Sky Lounge here

00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:19.893
where you can see

00:30:19.933 --> 00:30:21.653
the Jingzhou's night view.

00:30:22.012 --> 00:30:22.692
It's stunning.

00:30:22.893 --> 00:30:23.813
I take her there often.

00:30:24.373 --> 00:30:25.573
Why not mention it sooner?

00:30:25.732 --> 00:30:26.813
We made plans

00:30:26.853 --> 00:30:27.692
to go shopping.

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:31.333
But the Sky Lounge is amazing.

00:30:31.613 --> 00:30:32.853
It's a must-see in Jingzhou.

00:30:33.492 --> 00:30:34.212
Another day?

00:30:35.413 --> 00:30:35.853
Sure.

00:30:36.853 --> 00:30:37.292
Next time.

00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:40.573
Excuse me.

00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:45.893
Eat raw food?

00:30:45.972 --> 00:30:46.853
Yes, okay.

00:30:46.893 --> 00:30:47.292
Eat it.

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:47.972
Okay, thanks.

00:30:48.212 --> 00:30:48.573
Here.

00:30:49.012 --> 00:30:49.532
I'll do it.

00:30:49.772 --> 00:30:50.252
Alright.

00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:51.532
Thank you.

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:16.613
You talked quite a lot today.

00:31:18.532 --> 00:31:19.413
Think I enjoy this?

00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:20.933
Just to let him know

00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:21.813
you love him deeply.

00:31:23.492 --> 00:31:24.093
Why?

00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:27.413
I consulted a lawyer.

00:31:27.692 --> 00:31:28.972
The lawyer said

00:31:29.373 --> 00:31:30.813
as long as your relationship

00:31:30.813 --> 00:31:31.573
is genuine,

00:31:31.813 --> 00:31:33.052
and the man believes

00:31:33.093 --> 00:31:33.813
you love him,

00:31:33.853 --> 00:31:35.012
while he loves you too,

00:31:35.413 --> 00:31:36.452
and then even if the truth

00:31:36.492 --> 00:31:37.692
comes out,

00:31:37.972 --> 00:31:38.893
as long as he chooses

00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:39.772
to stand by you,

00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:41.252
you won't be put in jail.

00:31:50.252 --> 00:31:51.492
Don't think this means

00:31:51.532 --> 00:31:52.893
I approve of what you're doing.

00:31:53.813 --> 00:31:54.373
Have any idea

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:55.613
what I felt today

00:31:55.653 --> 00:31:58.093
hearing those dishes name?

00:31:58.492 --> 00:32:00.613
I felt so worried.

00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:01.532
So scary!

00:32:03.252 --> 00:32:04.732
You must've been scared too, right?

00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:08.012
Why that look?

00:32:11.813 --> 00:32:12.333
Nothing.

00:32:13.853 --> 00:32:14.972
I just want to say that

00:32:17.532 --> 00:32:19.093
you could join us for meals more often

00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:20.933
to upgrade your dining.

00:32:24.972 --> 00:32:26.732
Not afraid I'll reveal your secret

00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:27.933
and cause you trouble?

00:32:30.093 --> 00:32:31.653
It's okay. Not that bad.

00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:33.853
That works.

00:32:34.573 --> 00:32:36.173
Then I'll just keep brainwashing him,

00:32:36.452 --> 00:32:38.052
and reminding him how much you love him.

00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:41.052
No need.

00:32:43.093 --> 00:32:43.972
He can feel

00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:45.012
how much I love him.

00:32:45.772 --> 00:32:46.933
Don't be that confident.

00:32:47.573 --> 00:32:48.893
Men are oblivious.

00:32:49.052 --> 00:32:50.173
Think he understands,

00:32:50.373 --> 00:32:51.212
what if he

00:32:51.252 --> 00:32:52.413
feels nothing at all?

00:32:52.692 --> 00:32:53.853
Watched those TV commercials,

00:32:53.893 --> 00:32:54.452
didn't you?

00:32:54.653 --> 00:32:55.492
Remind him

00:32:55.653 --> 00:32:56.413
again and again.

00:32:56.452 --> 00:32:58.012
Even it means countless times.

00:32:58.012 --> 00:32:58.933
To let him remember

00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:00.093
how much you love him.

00:33:04.613 --> 00:33:05.653
I saw you smiling.

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:06.492
What's funny?

00:33:10.052 --> 00:33:10.972
You're quite adorable.

00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:12.133
Talk less.

00:33:12.972 --> 00:33:14.333
Well, I know

00:33:14.373 --> 00:33:15.653
I'm adorable.

00:33:17.173 --> 00:33:18.292
But listen.

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:19.692
You still need

00:33:19.732 --> 00:33:20.452
to talk it out

00:33:20.492 --> 00:33:21.613
to your husband, okay?

00:33:26.692 --> 00:33:27.732
Feels like we haven't

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:29.133
walked like this in ages, right?

00:33:38.692 --> 00:33:39.532
Cool!

00:33:39.732 --> 00:33:41.452
Exactly. So cool!

00:33:57.692 --> 00:33:58.532
What are you seeing?

00:33:59.653 --> 00:34:00.492
Nothing.

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:01.613
Let's go home.

00:34:08.452 --> 00:34:09.132
Qiao Yan.

00:34:12.012 --> 00:34:12.853
Take it.

00:34:14.612 --> 00:34:15.572
What's this about?

00:34:16.092 --> 00:34:16.853
Keep it.

00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:18.213
I don't want it.

00:34:18.733 --> 00:34:19.853
Just take it.

00:34:20.132 --> 00:34:21.532
You always came

00:34:21.612 --> 00:34:22.813
to see this thing,

00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:24.012
so I'll give you mine.

00:34:24.773 --> 00:34:25.532
What about you?

00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.413
My birthday is next month.

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:29.012
I'll have my parents buy me

00:34:29.052 --> 00:34:29.972
a new MP4 player.

00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:33.492
Alright, try it.

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:34.933
The sound is great.

00:34:44.853 --> 00:34:46.172
Can you hear it?

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.532
No sound.

00:34:49.572 --> 00:34:50.532
Impossible.

00:34:54.452 --> 00:34:55.572
Can you hear it now?

00:34:59.012 --> 00:34:59.933
There are

00:35:00.092 --> 00:35:01.333
all my favorite songs in it.

00:35:02.572 --> 00:35:03.652
You can download

00:35:03.693 --> 00:35:04.853
your favorite songs.

00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:05.532
Okay.

00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:07.333
Do you like the music?

00:35:07.492 --> 00:35:08.092
It's good.

00:35:17.012 --> 00:35:17.813
The night view

00:35:17.813 --> 00:35:19.213
is truly stunning.

00:35:22.132 --> 00:35:23.652
Sky Lounge, right?

00:35:23.853 --> 00:35:25.012
When do you take me there?

00:35:26.293 --> 00:35:27.132
Anytime.

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:29.293
Sky Lounge.

00:35:29.532 --> 00:35:31.213
I want to visit the museum,

00:35:31.652 --> 00:35:32.172
anime expos,

00:35:32.492 --> 00:35:33.733
water parks,

00:35:33.893 --> 00:35:34.532
and that

00:35:35.172 --> 00:35:35.693
aquarium.

00:35:42.213 --> 00:35:43.213
Ruyi!

00:35:43.293 --> 00:35:44.893
From now on, you're my horse.

00:35:45.132 --> 00:35:46.213
I'll take good care of you.

00:35:46.773 --> 00:35:47.253
Haochen.

00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:50.293
Haochen.

00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:51.612
Are you hot?

00:35:55.452 --> 00:35:57.132
Haoming had things to do,

00:35:57.373 --> 00:35:57.933
so I'm here.

00:35:59.092 --> 00:35:59.452
Look!

00:36:00.172 --> 00:36:00.773
This...

00:36:02.052 --> 00:36:02.813
The cooling spray.

00:36:02.893 --> 00:36:03.452
Feel cooler?

00:36:07.693 --> 00:36:09.012
Switched horses already?

00:36:09.413 --> 00:36:10.492
This horse is cool!

00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:12.612
Cooler than the last one.

00:36:13.253 --> 00:36:14.413
I just talked

00:36:14.452 --> 00:36:15.213
with your coach.

00:36:15.492 --> 00:36:16.132
He said

00:36:17.012 --> 00:36:18.253
after switching horses,

00:36:18.492 --> 00:36:19.373
take it slow

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:20.333
and gradually adapt

00:36:20.733 --> 00:36:21.532
to the rhythm

00:36:21.572 --> 00:36:22.813
and movement.

00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:24.452
After you mount,

00:36:24.532 --> 00:36:25.293
be careful.

00:36:25.693 --> 00:36:26.652
And after that...

00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:27.693
Go away.

00:36:30.092 --> 00:36:30.693
Let's go.

00:36:31.092 --> 00:36:32.213
Be careful, Haochen.

00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:26.253
Haochen!

00:37:30.576 --> 00:37:33.904
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

00:37:34.813 --> 00:37:35.373
Haochen.

00:37:35.813 --> 00:37:36.452
This bone broth

00:37:36.492 --> 00:37:37.532
was simmered

00:37:37.572 --> 00:37:38.612
for three hours.

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.293
It has Chinese herbs

00:37:40.373 --> 00:37:41.092
to help your leg

00:37:41.172 --> 00:37:42.293
recover soon.

00:37:42.813 --> 00:37:43.452
Look at you.

00:37:43.733 --> 00:37:45.213
Why were you so careless?

00:37:45.893 --> 00:37:47.213
It wasn't his fault,

00:37:47.492 --> 00:37:48.652
but that riding club's fault.

00:37:48.972 --> 00:37:49.452
Understood?

00:37:49.652 --> 00:37:50.452
The coaches' fault.

00:37:51.092 --> 00:37:52.293
I'll find you a better club.

00:37:52.373 --> 00:37:53.012
Their coaches

00:37:53.132 --> 00:37:54.572
are all former professional racers

00:37:54.652 --> 00:37:55.333
with medals.

00:37:56.773 --> 00:37:58.693
You injured seriously.

00:37:59.413 --> 00:38:00.972
Don't move around out of impatience.

00:38:01.293 --> 00:38:02.012
It'd be terrible

00:38:02.172 --> 00:38:03.333
if you don't recover, got it?

00:38:04.132 --> 00:38:04.773
Hear that?

00:38:04.813 --> 00:38:05.773
Mom, Dad.

00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:07.132
Caregiver.

00:38:07.253 --> 00:38:07.612
Good.

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.293
Hello.

00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:12.132
I'm his mother.

00:38:12.492 --> 00:38:13.693
He has a fracture.

00:38:13.773 --> 00:38:14.972
Don't let him off his bed.

00:38:15.132 --> 00:38:16.413
We're counting on you.

00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:17.253
Trust me.

00:38:17.333 --> 00:38:18.052
Thank you.

00:38:18.172 --> 00:38:18.733
- Thank you.
- One last sip.

00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:20.532
Haochen.

00:38:20.893 --> 00:38:21.773
Dad and I

00:38:21.813 --> 00:38:23.172
have an engagement.

00:38:23.413 --> 00:38:24.492
We'll come tomorrow.

00:38:25.213 --> 00:38:25.813
We're leaving.

00:38:26.572 --> 00:38:27.893
Dinner with Shifeng's executives.

00:38:29.253 --> 00:38:29.652
Good boy.

00:38:31.132 --> 00:38:31.652
Yan.

00:38:31.733 --> 00:38:32.333
Thank you.

00:38:32.452 --> 00:38:33.012
Thank you.

00:38:33.052 --> 00:38:33.532
Okay.

00:38:35.893 --> 00:38:36.373
I'll do it.

00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:36.813
Here.

00:38:37.012 --> 00:38:38.092
Let me feed you, okay?

00:38:38.213 --> 00:38:38.773
Haoming.

00:38:44.933 --> 00:38:45.373
I need...

00:38:45.413 --> 00:38:46.213
I'm running late

00:38:46.452 --> 00:38:47.052
for a dinner.

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:49.813
Talk later.

00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.333
Here, take a sip.

00:39:10.612 --> 00:39:11.813
Come on. Drink more.

00:39:12.172 --> 00:39:12.492
Here.

00:39:13.012 --> 00:39:13.333
Right.

00:39:13.733 --> 00:39:14.052
Good.

00:39:30.652 --> 00:39:31.333
No more drinking.

00:39:32.132 --> 00:39:32.813
No more?

00:39:33.293 --> 00:39:35.733
Then... how about some fruits?

00:39:36.052 --> 00:39:36.572
Okay?

00:39:36.933 --> 00:39:37.452
Look.

00:39:37.532 --> 00:39:38.733
Pick something you like.

00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:40.172
I don't eat fruits.

00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:40.572
This...

00:39:41.293 --> 00:39:41.773
What's up?

00:39:41.773 --> 00:39:42.452
No!

00:39:42.893 --> 00:39:44.132
Leave! I don't want you!

00:39:44.213 --> 00:39:45.092
Just say it.

00:39:45.132 --> 00:39:46.052
- Leave!
- Why hit me?

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:46.612
Outrageous!

00:39:46.652 --> 00:39:47.092
What's up?

00:39:47.373 --> 00:39:47.693
No.

00:39:47.773 --> 00:39:49.012
Leave!

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:51.373
Stop talking to me!

00:39:52.132 --> 00:39:52.773
Stop it!

00:39:52.816 --> 00:39:53.712
- Leave!
- I quit!

00:39:55.373 --> 00:39:55.972
I'm sorry.

00:39:56.092 --> 00:39:56.773
So sorry.

00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:57.253
I quit.

00:39:57.413 --> 00:39:58.452
What about more money?

00:39:58.492 --> 00:39:59.333
No way.

00:39:59.853 --> 00:40:01.052
Never seen a child like this.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.092
I can't do it.

00:40:35.213 --> 00:40:36.733
I don't want to see you. Leave!

00:40:39.172 --> 00:40:39.853
I refuse.

00:40:40.253 --> 00:40:40.652
You!

00:40:41.373 --> 00:40:41.652
You!

00:40:41.693 --> 00:40:42.293
Kick me out.

00:40:43.092 --> 00:40:43.733
Come down here.

00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:46.253
It hurts.

00:40:46.452 --> 00:40:47.052
Can't get down.

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:49.532
Listen.

00:40:49.933 --> 00:40:50.652
You'll stay in bed

00:40:51.612 --> 00:40:52.933
for four weeks.

00:40:54.092 --> 00:40:55.092
Your parents

00:40:55.213 --> 00:40:55.693
and Haoming

00:40:56.532 --> 00:40:58.052
entrust you to me.

00:40:59.492 --> 00:41:00.693
During these four weeks,

00:41:01.773 --> 00:41:02.933
behave yourself.

00:41:04.052 --> 00:41:05.132
Otherwise,

00:41:06.853 --> 00:41:07.652
you'll suffer.

00:41:17.052 --> 00:41:17.652
Fine.

00:41:18.532 --> 00:41:20.092
If you stay here,

00:41:21.092 --> 00:41:22.253
get me some fruits.

00:41:25.293 --> 00:41:26.733
Take those leftover ones.

00:41:29.972 --> 00:41:30.413
I...

00:41:32.612 --> 00:41:34.012
I-I want water.

00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:48.172
Hurry up! I'm dying of thirst!

00:42:01.132 --> 00:42:02.293
It's too cold.

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:03.733
I always drink

00:42:03.773 --> 00:42:04.933
warm water.

00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:06.333
Knock it off.

00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:10.172
This is a hospital.

00:42:11.373 --> 00:42:13.172
You don't know me.

00:42:14.492 --> 00:42:15.733
I-I need food.

00:42:31.213 --> 00:42:32.893
I can't reach the fruit.

00:42:32.933 --> 00:42:33.652
Feed me one.

00:42:33.933 --> 00:42:35.012
Feed me this meal too.

00:42:37.532 --> 00:42:38.373
Your hands are hurt?

00:42:39.773 --> 00:42:41.132
The doctor never said that.

00:42:41.813 --> 00:42:42.413
Eat it.

00:42:45.853 --> 00:42:46.853
When Haoming was here,

00:42:46.893 --> 00:42:47.853
you treated me well.

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.492
Now that he's gone,

00:42:49.773 --> 00:42:50.733
you're bullying me?

00:42:50.773 --> 00:42:51.813
When Haoming was here,

00:42:51.853 --> 00:42:52.773
you were like an angel.

00:42:52.972 --> 00:42:54.693
Now that he's gone, you're bullying me?

00:42:55.612 --> 00:42:56.373
I'm injured.

00:42:56.413 --> 00:42:57.972
I-I'm a kid!

00:42:58.172 --> 00:42:59.012
If you bully me,

00:42:59.773 --> 00:43:01.293
my brother will punish you.

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:02.813
Alright.

00:43:04.773 --> 00:43:05.360
Skip the meal.

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:09.413
Stop it.

00:43:09.813 --> 00:43:11.492
What?

00:43:14.612 --> 00:43:15.253
What's wrong?

00:43:17.893 --> 00:43:18.733
I'll call the doctor.

00:43:18.773 --> 00:43:19.213
Wait.

00:43:19.612 --> 00:43:20.853
Hey,

00:43:20.972 --> 00:43:22.933
I need to pee.

00:43:23.293 --> 00:43:24.733
Just say it.

00:43:25.213 --> 00:43:26.172
Don't you see

00:43:26.213 --> 00:43:27.532
I'm clutching my stomach?

00:43:32.213 --> 00:43:32.773
Is this okay?

00:43:33.773 --> 00:43:34.213
I'll help.

00:43:34.572 --> 00:43:35.452
No! I'll do it myself.

00:43:39.893 --> 00:43:40.773
Watch me pee?
