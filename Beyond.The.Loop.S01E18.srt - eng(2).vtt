Grandfather, drink more.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.280
This dish was prepared by Mr. Yunhao.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800
Yunhao, your cooking skills are amazing!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.840
Yunqing, learn from Yunhao

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.640
and cook me some delicious dishes.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.960
If I ever master cooking,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.680
Yunhao will have to quit

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.760
as the family chef.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.520
Nonsense!

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.320
You're about to be a father,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.240
yet still talking nonsense.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.720
Eat up, everyone.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.600
We haven't

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
gathered to have a meal

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.200
for a long time.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.800
Today is a joyous occasion.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.840
Yunqing, Yunhao.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
Let's make a toast

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.480
to wish Wan good health,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.880
a safe delivery,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.240
and for adding a new member
to the our family.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.280
Thank you, Grandfather.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.920
Yunhao.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.880
Find me a sister-in-law!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.600
Hurry up.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.480
Him?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.120
He's not grown up yet,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.640
now still hanging around
those pleasure houses all day,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.920
enjoying his carefree life.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.360
How could he spare time to find a wife?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.320
Come on, let's eat.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.240
Here, let me toast you.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.360
Yunhao.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.680
Yunqing.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.400
Drink up!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.240
Yunhao, you are

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.800
at your age,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.040
not married,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.120
not chasing career,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.400
what do you want to do?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.320
W-What can I do?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.240
I've been cowardly since childhood,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.520
not cut out for great things.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.560
I'll just live off the family fortune.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.440
You have

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.320
the capabilities as the City Lord.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.240
Here, Yunhao.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.040
Here.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.600
Bottoms up!

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.200
Let me check. There's some left.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.280
To be honest...

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.640
Go ahead.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.320
I'm tire

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.560
of being the City Lord.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.640
I wanted to quit long ago.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.520
Yunhao, why don't you take over?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.920
Nonsense!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.720
Yunhao.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.800
You are the City Lord.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.680
I'm telling you, you're drunk.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.840
Just focus on being the City Lord.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.680
Grandfather is watching you.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.120
Later, let Wan help you back.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.480
I-I should...

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.560
Yunhao, another cup!

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.200
You're drunk.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.320
Wan will come get you later.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.200
I'm leaving.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.760
Yunhao, take care.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.160
After the physician treated Mr. Yunhao,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.176
and I escorted him out.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.880
He said something strange.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.080
Strange?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.880
The physician said

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.560
Mr. Yunhao's wound

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.400
seems to be stabbed

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.640
by himself.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.920
(What am I thinking?)

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.840
(Why would Yunhao harm me?)

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.680
Husband.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.720
I made you this hangover soup.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.280
Taste good?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.000
Yes.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.240
Are you drunk?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.000
I can drink more than Yunhao.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.760
Let's go for a walk.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.440
Alright.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.400
Let's go.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.320
For the children?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.800
That design is beautiful.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Almost sold out.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.120
How much?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.760
Three coins. Pretty.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.320
Come see the lanterns!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.720
Come see the lanterns!

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.120
Children love them.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.640
We have all kinds of shapes here.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.640
I wish time could freeze at this moment,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.520
so we could be this happy forever.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.400
Then you better treat me well,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.360
or I'll run away.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.840
You won't.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.000
I am sure about that.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.720
Wait for me.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.520
You kid.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.560
Here, take it.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.720
Thank you.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.040
Mother.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.960
Candied haws.

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:21.472
Candied haws again?

00:07:21.472 --> 00:07:23.640
Yunqing, when our child is born,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.000
we'll be happier than them.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.520
You love children so much?

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.960
Then have a few more.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.360
You think giving birth

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.160
is that easy?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.680
How about this?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.440
I'll give birth to them, okay?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
Fine, you'll do it.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.760
Try having one then.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.920
I'll do it.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.240
Lanterns!

00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:52.680
What's the occasion?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.600
So many lanterns!

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.120
Madam.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.120
The Lantern Festival is in half a month.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.640
Lantern Festival?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.920
Look, I bought you a jade pendant.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.760
Wan, what's wrong?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.680
Yunqing, I'm not feeling well.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.840
Let's go home.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.480
Are you okay?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.480
Alright. Sorry.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.559
Let's go home.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.080
What's with you today?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.320
Don't move.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.240
At today's dinner,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.640
Mu Yunqing acted strange.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.720
I think we can't keep this
hidden much longer.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.560
Today I kept thinking

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.640
if I hadn't fought for this position,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.680
we might've had our own child

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.360
and our own courtyard by now.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.960
Or even,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.880
our own piece of land.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.320
Yunhao, no matter what happens,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.400
I'll always stay by your side.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.200
Okay.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.400
(I'll definitely help you
eliminate Mu Yunqing)

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.200
(and reclaim the City Lord Token.)

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.320
You poisoned my lady,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.480
yet you came to me now?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.360
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.600
What?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.600
The Yu family is just merchants.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.600
What makes
a skilled person like you obey them

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.280
is nothing

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.200
but sufficient payment.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.560
Think you can buy me off
with this little?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.920
This is just the deposit.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.880
Tenfold after success.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.840
What do you want me to do?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.120
Yu Yingwan is such a nuisance.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.720
You know what to do.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.800
Working with you is risky.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.880
I want to meet your master.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360
Deal.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.600
City Lord, terrible!

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
Madam has gone missing!

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.600
Lady.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.520
Lady.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.120
Liu Bingmo, where are we?

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.280
No idea. I just woke up too.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.040
What happened?

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.160
Are we kidnapped?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.120
Maybe last night's soup was poisoned.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The soup was poisoned?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.760
Well, back-to-back.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.400
I'll untie you.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.880
Hurry.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.360
Will this work?

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.600
Let's try.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.640
Trying to escape?
