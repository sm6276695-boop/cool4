[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 13]

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.800
[Three hours earlier]

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100
This is the telegram record

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.660
that Liang's bureau intercepted

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.820
from the Japanese Navy.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.260
Their surveillance technology
isn't great.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.820
They've been listening for months,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.980
but only managed to decipher
a few scattered bytes.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.260
But last month,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.820
they picked up the Navy

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.180
and a station with the codename K.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.820
They've been sending messages

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.740
by using off-frequency communication.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.450
Liang was planning to give this record

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.890
to Mr. Takeda,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.730
but I think I remember

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.290
K

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.100
is the codename for a radio station

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.290
at the MSS.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.940
It's on fire!

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660
Get out, everyone!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.100
Charlie! Charlie!

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.980
It's on fire!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.260
Quick, quick, quick!

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.260
Mr. Lee!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.660
Charlie!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.260
It's on fire!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.260
Hurry!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.780
This way!

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.290
Quick!

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.610
It's on fire!

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.500
Get lost!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.460
The rabbit is finally coming out of
the hole.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.580
Put out the fire!

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.580
Get more people!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.020
Hurry!

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.220
Put out the fire!

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.220
Mr. Takeda.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.020
Are Joseph Lee and Charlie on the ship?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.780
Yes, they're on board.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.700
Inoue and Kimura

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.900
are keeping an eye on them.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.700
Split up.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.700
Good.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.460
KLX83!

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.460
You must stop your ship right now

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.340
immediately for our inspection!

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.460
KLX83!

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.460
You must stop your ship right now!

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.900
K...

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.020
They don't seem to hear us.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.580
Fire a warning shot.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.900
It's stopped.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.700
Prepare to board.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.460
Yes.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.100
Sir, can you tell me what's happening?

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.140
Where are you going?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.780
Stay out of the way!

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.220
Oh, my God!

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.780
I'm the captain.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.340
What rights do you have

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.700
to stop our merchant ship?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.580
Step aside!

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.460
What's the meaning of this?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.900
I suspect there are spies on your ship

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.900
that our Empire of Japan

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.780
is hunting.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.900
You should be thinking about

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.700
how to explain it after we find them.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.340
We don't understand what you're saying.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.780
I don't have time to waste with you!

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.460
Get out of the way!

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.340
After him!

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.340
Mr. Lee!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.100
Stop!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.220
Stop!

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.700
Stop!

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.610
Stop!

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.300
What are you doing?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.940
Stop!

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.100
Stop!

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.220
Didn't I tell you

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.610
to stop?

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.940
I'm sorry!

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.460
What in the world are you people doing?

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.250
Colonel.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.850
Joseph Lee tried to flee

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.820
and was executed on the spot.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.490
These are the incriminating photos

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.220
we collected of his attempted escape.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.180
Mr. Takeda, where have you been?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.180
You're alive.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.010
Mr. Takeda.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.100
Did you really want me dead?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.940
You...

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.580
How are you here?

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.700
The Army Hospital caught fire.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.180
The fire was huge,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.180
and you weren't there.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.580
So, I had to

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.850
come straight to the Colonel.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.140
Colonel.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.740
I don't know
what tricks Joseph Lee is playing

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.980
to get here,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.740
but those photos

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.860
are indeed evidence of
his attempted escape.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.260
How do you explain
these photos of you meeting?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.220
What photos?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.530
Xian Biyun, Charlie,

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.380
and the Deputy Commander
of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.980
an Englishman named Frank.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.020
Ms. Xian has always been very close

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.340
with the British social circles.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.500
I don't think it's strange
that they would be together.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.530
However,

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.340
if Mr. Takeda still has doubts

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.020
about the content of the photos,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.530
you can simply invite Ms. Xian here

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.980
and ask her directly.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.340
That would clear things up.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.860
Then let's have Ms. Xian
come to the MSS.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.980
Get out of the way!

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.260
Mr. Lee!

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.020
Move!

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.290
Mr. Lee.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.980
Are you hurt?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.530
No, don't worry.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.620
They just told me

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.260
the Army Hospital was on fire.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.100
I was so scared.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.860
I'm okay.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.890
Thanks to the Colonel,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.020
I'm fine.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.020
Ms. Xian,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.740
please explain

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.500
what's in these photos.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.570
Mr. Takeda,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.260
you had me followed?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.740
If we hadn't been following you,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.340
how would we have

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.740
found out
you were helping Joseph Lee escape?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.140
Upon investigation,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.980
we learned that

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.650
lately,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.860
you've been in close contact

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.260
with Frank, the Deputy Commander
of the British Volunteer Corps.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.860
Therefore, we suspect

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.980
that Joseph Lee
passed our encryption methods

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.530
to Frank through you.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.890
This is what caused

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.220
the intelligence leak.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.140
And that is why

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.260
this man, Frank,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.140
helped Joseph Lee board his ship

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.500
to escape tonight.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.380
Frank is an old friend of mine.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.530
We just met up as friends.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.140
How does that make me

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.530
a messenger?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.530
But in this past week,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.220
you met five times in a row.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.980
And each time,
right after you left the MSS,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.740
you went to see him immediately.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.740
I must ask,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.380
what kind of friends

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.740
need to meet so frequently?

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.890
I'll explain it to you privately.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.620
I want to hear it right now.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.740
Colonel.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.690
May I speak?

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.530
The reason Frank and I met so frequently

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.650
is because we were discussing

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.020
the distribution of Asia's God of War

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.020
in the Public Concession.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.380
Colonel hopes
that our film will have at least

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.020
80% or more of the screenings,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.500
and in terms of revenue sharing,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.340
a portion is reserved for him privately.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.020
The negotiations were difficult.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.530
I needed to communicate
with both sides frequently.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.530
That's why every time I left

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.690
the Colonel's office,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.980
I would go straight to see Frank.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.260
But I was just doing this

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.380
for the Empire of Japan.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.260
What about the map you gave Joseph Lee?

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.170
Was that for the film distribution, too?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.620
Map?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.980
You thought that by using
a lover's relationship as a cover,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.020
and hiding the intelligence
in a lucky charm,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.530
we wouldn't find it?

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.980
This map that you secretly

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.980
gave Joseph Lee

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.740
was to instruct him

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.220
on how to find the Englishman's ship,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.860
so he could board it
and escape to China Hong Kong tonight.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.340
You must keep this safe.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.860
How do you

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.620
explain this?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.260
I...

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.860
I was just helping Frank

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.260
to give that safety amulet to Mr. Lee.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.860
But I didn't know

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.980
there was a map inside.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.140
Mr. Lee!

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.290
I don't know.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.810
What map?

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.980
You don't know,
but Charlie doesn't either?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.500
You couldn't see it,
but Charlie couldn't either?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.260
Oh, right.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.020
Where's Charlie?

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.260
I'm afraid
you can't talk your way out of this.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.020
So let me do the talking for you.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.980
Charlie...

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.740
Why are you taking my case?

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.620
I need to see Mr. Lee.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.860
Why won't you let me see Mr. Lee?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.980
Charlie!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.620
Get in here.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.220
Let me in.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.740
I told you,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.330
there's nothing here!

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.740
Why are you grabbing my case?

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.740
Ms. Xian?

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.020
You're here too?

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.740
Who is he?

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.290
He's

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.220
Joseph Lee's assistant,

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.020
Charlie Gu.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.220
Charlie.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.260
Mr. Lee.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.290
How did you get here?

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.090
Mr. Lee, I came to...

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.980
After I finished my errand,
I came back to the hospital

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.810
and found it on fire.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.020
I couldn't find you.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.810
Then I heard that

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.810
you had come to Colonel Sasaki's office,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.980
so I rushed over.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.020
But they wouldn't let me in,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.980
so I made a scene

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.570
and barged in anyway.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.020
Charlie.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.020
What do you have there?

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.020
It's nothing.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.180
Open it.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.180
This is Mr. Lee's stuff.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.180
I can't open it.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.050
Charlie!

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.180
Please don't make me.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.810
Give it to me! Give it!

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.290
Why is it alcohol?

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.020
These

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.020
are what I asked Charlie to
pick up for me.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.260
The map and the ship number

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.020
were also for Charlie to see.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.530
But the map has no info
on getting alcohol.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.850
The map.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.700
Map.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.050
What are you doing?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.330
Your hand.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.940
Hand.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.050
Give it to me.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.570
Feel it.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.290
Feel it.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.420
What is this?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.530
Braille.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.570
Alcohol to be checked tonight.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.330
If Mr. Takeda doesn't believe us,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.460
you can bring in
a Braille translator to verify it.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.810
Guards.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.530
Take this and have it checked.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.090
Yes, sir.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.740
You promised me

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.420
that you wouldn't drink alcohol

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.260
until you recovered.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.260
But

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.020
if you were only going to get alcohol,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.020
why did you have to be
so secretive about it?

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.810
I didn't want to be so secretive.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.940
It's just a few bottles of wine.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.050
But Captain Kobayashi

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.090
refused me.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.180
Ms. Xian said that since I was injured,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.740
drinking would be bad for my health.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.980
She advised me to quit.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.740
Out of my love for her,

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.770
I pretended to agree to her request.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.740
But

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.610
I have a really bad alcohol addiction.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.050
Then I found out

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.290
a British merchant ship
was coming from Tianjin,

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.740
and it happened to have a batch of

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.050
my favorite whiskey.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.290
But Captain Kobayashi

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.700
wouldn't let me leave the Army Hospital.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.020
So I had to resort to this.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.900
Sorry, my love.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.020
I...

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.810
I lied to you.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.850
If you wanted a drink,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.740
you should have just told Mr. Takeda.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.810
I don't think he would've stopped you,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.050
instead of causing this huge commotion.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.810
Is that true?

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.260
Colonel,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.660
he did say so,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.050
but according to Mr. Takeda's orders
at the time,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.330
Joseph Lee was not allowed
to leave the Army Hospital freely.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.810
So I had to

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.570
reject his request.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.610
Colonel.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.370
Come in.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.180
Have you translated it?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.530
It says,
"Alcohol to be checked tonight."

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.570
Alcohol to be checked tonight.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.420
Stop this act!

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.740
Colonel.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.180
Don't believe them!

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.460
This is a carefully woven trap

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.740
they all planned together!

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.500
He doesn't believe us.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.740
Joseph Lee tried to flee.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.090
I sent a team to
chase him onto the ship.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.810
Joseph Lee was shot,

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.370
and Charlie jumped into
the river to save him.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.130
At the time,
Kobayashi, Inoue, and Kimura

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.460
all saw it.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.050
When we were retreating,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.570
Joseph Lee's car

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.260
was clearly still at the dock.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.530
Your initial plan

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.330
was to escape.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.940
I intercepted your ship
at the last minute,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.180
your escape failed,

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.020
and you were afraid
the truth would be exposed,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.290
so you concocted

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.220
this elaborate lie
to deceive the Colonel!

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.530
Mr. Takeda,

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.180
who's really good at
making up stories here?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.770
You can mistake people, let alone a car.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.020
You said Mr. Lee was shot
and fell into the river,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.530
but Mr. Lee is sitting here,
perfectly fine.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.740
You said I jumped into the river
to save Mr. Lee,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.330
but I'm wearing the same clothes
I was this morning,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.020
and my clothes are completely dry.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.020
Aren't you just lying
through your teeth?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.290
Unbelievable!

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.090
Enough!

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.500
What did I do wrong

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.740
to make Mr. Takeda

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.940
constantly targeting me,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.330
even going so far as to create

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.740
such an absurd lie

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.330
to frame me?

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.290
Why did my godfather

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.940
make me design this code for you?

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.220
It was to make the Army's code system

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.810
completely independent of the Navy's.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.570
I listened to him

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.330
and put my life's work into it,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.940
designing this groundbreaking

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.530
code for you.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.020
By all rights,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.260
the MSS should treat me as
a respected man.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.330
But instead,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.260
Mr. Takeda constantly targets me.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.020
He even suspects that
I'm the one who leaked the code!

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.020
You all know that

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.460
for this code system,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.530
I only designed the algorithm.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.810
I don't know the key at all.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.020
How could I possibly have leaked

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.500
the entire code?

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.700
If this code

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.290
was really leaked by me,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.290
why did I warn you, Mr. Takeda,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.330
at the Metropolitan Hotel?

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.770
I still remember

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.330
at the Metropolitan Hotel,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.290
I begged Mr. Takeda

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.770
to temporarily stop using this code

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.330
and test if it had been leaked.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.500
But you refused.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.020
Now that I think about it,
I finally understand.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.740
Mr. Takeda didn't want anyone to know

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.050
that the code had been leaked,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.020
so he could continue to gain

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.700
his own secret profits.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.260
So, I have reason to suspect

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.500
that you, Mr. Takeda,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.330
are the one who really leaked the code.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.940
Nonsense!

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.810
I am a soldier of
the Empire of Japan.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.500
I am loyal to the Emperor!

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:22.530
How could I leak the code?

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.090
Really?

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.020
But Charlie told me last time

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.500
that Dr. Miyamoto couldn't land on time

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.810
due to the chicken plague.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.330
It was you, Mr. Takeda,

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.330
who used your personal connections
with the Navy

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.330
to coordinate it.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.940
Mr. Takeda has such deep ties
with the Navy.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.330
Then it's not impossible that this code

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.020
was leaked to the Navy by you.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.610
So answer me, Mr. Takeda,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.770
why would you go to such lengths

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.330
to betray for your own gain?

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.050
Who is the biggest beneficiary of this?

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:56.940
Colonel.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.530
I admit I used the Navy's power.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.020
But I only borrowed their ship.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.260
I swear it was just this one time.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.050
Joseph Lee was trying to
escape at the time.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.330
I had no choice but to do that.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.810
Then whose power

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.020
did you use?

The biggest beneficiary

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.700
should be you, Takeda.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.660
You're the illegitimate son

of the Kumamoto family.

You're trying to be accepted back
into the Kumamoto family, right?

Please give me one more chance.

I will prove myself to you.

Takeda.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.900
I remember telling you that

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.180
no matter what the truth is,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.610
the person who leaked the code

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.700

Colonel!

Just one more chance!

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.290
I'll prove it to you, Colonel!

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.740
I won't be defeated!

Mr. Lee,

this whole charade
has been unsettling for you.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.090
Takeda does not represent the MSS.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.740
He will be punished.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.700
Joseph,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.940
I'll be checking them
in a couple of days.

You can't drink any of them.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.900
So, as long as we can handle

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.220
Schwarz's inspection,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.330
[A few days earlier]
we can proceed with

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.570
the operation against Takeda.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.810
First,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.330
we need to test and see if Sasaki

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.330
knows about Takeda's relationship
with the Navy.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.050
If I say you aren't good to me,

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.740
you even went so far
as to mobilize the Navy

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.940
to bring Dr. Miyamoto to treat my eyes.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.290
Why didn't Sasaki

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.700
even show up?

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.700
Sasaki didn't show up today,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.900
but judging by Takeda's reaction,

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.420
we must have been right.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.460
Getting the Navy involved
was Takeda's personal action.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.810
Sasaki probably just found out.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.330
But aren't they

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.740
all Japanese?

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.290
What's wrong with Takeda

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.090
asking the Navy for help?

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.220
The Army and Navy are like
fire and water right now.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.090
Sasaki would never use that record

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.500
to confront the Navy.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.260
Even if he did,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.090
he'd first suspect the Navy,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.420
not us.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.020
Let's look like we're having fun.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.810
Someone is taking pictures outside.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.740
People with normal vision

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.020
rely on their eyes
to perceive the world.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.770
So the first thing they'll see

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.090
is the information on the map.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.570
The Braille punched into it

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.420
is impossible to notice
unless you feel it carefully.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.900
Good evening.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.330

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.180

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.050
Okay.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.460

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.130
that you wouldn't drink?

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.370

not Ding Yi.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.540
This is bad.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.780
I thought after taking down Takeda,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.980
Dr. Miyamoto wouldn't come.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.780
But I just received a message

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.850
that he has already arrived

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.460
Ms. Xian,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.460
can we talk for a minute?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.980
Once Dr. Miyamoto starts treating him,

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.610
he'll definitely be exposed.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.130
And we're running out of time.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.810
How about we try Meng Jie's method

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.780
and use chlorpheniramine?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.370
No.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.300
None of us know

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.130
what kind of damage will

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.540
a large dose of chlorpheniramine do

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.610
to Ding Yi's body.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.130
If we can't handle the examination,

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.810
it'll just cause more trouble.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.940
How about this?

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.850
I'll go find Sasaki

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.940
and try to buy some time.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.940
That won't work.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.330
If you go to him now,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.460
it'll only make him suspicious.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.220

This morning, the Japanese
went to see Dr. Schwarz again.

to conduct
a joint consultation on Mr. Lee.

Luckily, Dr. Schwarz
wasn't at the clinic this morning,

Thank you, Meng Jie.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.610

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.340
to the professionals.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.020
We'll just wait patiently outside.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.130
Please prepare a cup of coffee for me.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.290
Please prepare a cup of coffee for him.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.340
What's up?

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.610
Dr. Miyamoto wants to drink some coffee.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.570
Dr. Miyamoto wants to drink some coffee.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.290
Coffee?

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.460
Thank you.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.460
The coffee in Shanghai
tastes better than in Tokyo.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.290
Mr. Lee, are you sleepy?

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:10.690
Mr. Lee, are you sleepy?

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.770
Maybe it's because the work at the MSS

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.650
has been too demanding recently.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.130
And there was a fire last night.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.900
I'm exhausted.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.900
You still need to get more rest.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.290
Work never ends.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.540
Many human illnesses

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.340
are caused by overwork.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.770
Speaking of fires,

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.290
Dr. Miyamoto's trip to China this time

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.130
was also delayed because of
the avian influenza at the dock,

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.290
which postponed the time
he came to treat you.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.460
Life, huh?

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.460
It's never smooth sailing.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.460
Speaking of Dr. Miyamoto's experience
being stuck on the ship,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.130
it's quite memorable.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.770
On the first day...

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.650
Get me a cup of coffee too.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.690
What is it now?

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.060
He wants another one.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.610
Dr. Miyamoto said
the coffee in Shanghai is delicious.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.210
He's a little tired
and needs to perk up.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.650
Go get another cup of coffee.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.130
Okay.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:44.690
And he was like that
for three whole days.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.210
By the third day...

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.690
How many more days will it take?

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.610
Dr. Miyamoto,

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.460
why don't we start the examination?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.770
So Mr. Lee can go back and rest early.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.420
You're right.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.770
I got so carried away talking
that I forgot.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.290
He forgot when he started talking.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.690
Please cooperate with the doctor.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.210
Control your eyeballs

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.770
and move them down.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.820
What's going on?
The intraocular pressure is so high.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.460
Dr. Miyamoto,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.610
this is the patient's previous
medical record.
