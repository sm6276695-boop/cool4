00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:53.596
Xiaoge.

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:55.716
Does it

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:56.876
remind you of anything?

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:03.179
Hey.

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:03.876
There's writing.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:14.992
(The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.
Enter to obtain paradise.)

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.236
What does it say

00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:19.115
down there?

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:23.435
The owner of this shipwreck
built a heavenly palace.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:25.875
And the entrance to it

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.595
is inside this stone stele.

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.296
If you're the fated one,

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:31.236
(Heavenly Gate)
you can enter heaven through it.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.435
For real?

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:38.555
There is

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.115
a gate here?

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.555
These words sound like Zen teachings.

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.316
But interpretations
vary among individuals.

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:50.476
The original meaning

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:52.636
wasn't about a physical gate.

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:54.835
It says this stone stele

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:58.196
might conceal some hidden contents.

00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:00.636
Hidden contents?

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.196
This stele looks completely bare.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:04.196
What hidden contents

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:05.476
can there be?

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.316
You're not the fated one.

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:08.476
So you don't see it.

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.395
You brat.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:13.155
Learned to mock me, huh?

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.395
Your third uncle was fated.

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:16.555
Well?

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.916
Where is he now?

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:26.636
Do you think

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:28.595
maybe your third uncle

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:31.236
was too fated with the Heavenly Gate

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:34.076
and has entered the heavenly palace?

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.636
We're running out of time.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.275
We've stayed here too long.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:52.516
We're certainly getting

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:54.956
acquainted with this water.

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.715
Look how fast the water's rising.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.995
Soon we won't even make it out.

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:03.395
Alright, I'll get Xiaoge.

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:10.675
Where is he?

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.076
Wasn't he just here?

00:04:15.996 --> 00:04:16.676
Xiaoge.

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:17.475
Xiaoge!

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:19.235
Xiaoge!

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:21.076
Xiaoge.

00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:23.275
Always so elusive.

00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:31.636
Xiaoge.

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:44.196
Why are you hiding here?

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:45.316
Are you alright?

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:48.756
I remembered

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.035
what happened 20 years ago.

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:55.116
♪Dear friends♪

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:57.155
♪Who owns this glorious spring♪

00:04:57.475 --> 00:05:00.275
♪You and me♪

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.795
♪The new generation of the 80s♪

00:05:11.676 --> 00:05:12.475
Check this out.

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.556
The ballast stones look fishy.

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:15.835
What's wrong?

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:18.155
Look, there are patterns

00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:19.275
with inscriptions below.

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:20.835
I know about this.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.915
It says the production site
of the ballast stone.

00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:24.756
Qi You.

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:27.715
No, production site codes
aren't formatted this way.

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:31.395
These characters
resemble the ballast stone patterns.

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:33.795
It's probably the artist's first name.

00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:35.996
Ancient people valued their surnames.

00:05:35.996 --> 00:05:37.676
How could it be a first name?

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:38.756
It makes even less sense.

00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:40.035
Look at this circle.

00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:41.076
The stroke order.

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:41.475
Right?

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:42.475
Whose name is it?

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.116
It doesn't matter whose name it is.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:46.715
It's someone's first name.

00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:50.436
Zhang, help me figure this out.

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:12.996
These carved words

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:15.756
are ordered based
on the ballast stones' layout.

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.475
They depict the construction
of a massive project.

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:20.516
Massive project?

00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:22.636
What massive project?

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:26.956
- Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.
- Heavenly Palace on the Clouds?

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:27.676
What?

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:28.816
What did you say?

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:30.076
He's referring to

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:31.876
the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:33.316
built by ghost hand Wang Zanghai.

00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:34.676
Yeah, I've heard of it.

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:35.795
Is this real?

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.155
They say that Wang Zanghai

00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:41.235
used giant kites with vast amounts

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.956
of golden threads

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:44.956
to create an illusion of a magnificent

00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:48.076
floating palace to please the emperor.

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.876
If these ballast stones
document history,

00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:53.275
that would be a major discovery.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.768
- Really?
- Really?

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:56.676
I'm going in.

00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:57.915
There will be more clues.

00:06:58.475 --> 00:06:59.395
Fantastic.

00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:02.516
No way, Zhang.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:03.876
No way.

00:07:04.795 --> 00:07:06.556
We've lost one person.

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.636
We can't afford any more mistakes.

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:10.316
Let go.

00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:14.956
Thank you.

00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:15.956
Zhang.

00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:23.116
Let's just follow him.

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:25.316
It's the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:26.436
Aren't you curious?

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.436
Of course, we are.

00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:30.676
I say we go together

00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:31.915
to watch each other's backs.

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.316
Alright, let's go.

00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:34.556
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:35.395
Let's go.

00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:38.275
Alright then.

00:07:39.756 --> 00:07:41.275
He's still sleeping.

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:42.316
Should we wake him up?

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.196
No, he's got a temper.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:46.475
He'll fight with Zhang if we wake him.

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:48.516
Right. Good point.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:50.876
So, let's go.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.076
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:52.516
Let's go.

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:54.795
Let's take a look

00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:55.915
and get out fast.

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:57.556
But no one

00:07:57.756 --> 00:07:59.316
should touch anything inside.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.795
- No problem. Let's go.
- Alright.

00:08:41.196 --> 00:08:42.076
Zhang.

00:08:58.436 --> 00:08:59.355
What's that?

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:00.475
Where?

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:00.995
There.

00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:02.556
It's blurry.

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:04.835
Keep going.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:05.276
Let's go.

00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:52.755
Check this out.

00:09:56.676 --> 00:10:00.835
The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.

00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:04.355
Enter to obtain paradise.

00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:07.635
The heavenly palace is real?

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:10.036
(Heavenly Gate)
This is unbelievable.

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:10.796
Indeed.

00:10:16.436 --> 00:10:17.835
It's time.

00:10:18.715 --> 00:10:19.835
We should head back.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:21.936
Let's go.

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:23.115
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:26.835
Careful.

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:34.556
Wait.

00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:36.156
Where's Zhang?

00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:38.556
Right.

00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:40.396
Zhang!

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.835
Let's go, Zhang!

00:10:43.196 --> 00:10:44.036
- Zhang, stop looking!
- Zhang, stop looking!

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:44.515
Let's go!

00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:45.436
Come on, Zhang!

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:48.595
Zhang.

00:10:50.396 --> 00:10:51.156
Zhang.

00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:54.835
Zhang, we need to leave.

00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:55.835
What are you doing?

00:10:57.316 --> 00:10:58.196
Zhang?

00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:13.835
- Wenjin!
- Wenjin!

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:17.276
Where is she?

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:19.755
Do you think

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:22.515
there could be ghosts down there?

00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:23.676
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:25.235
There is no such thing.

00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:26.436
I'll check.

00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:29.076
Huo Ling, don't.

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:29.835
Huo Ling.

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:30.995
Be careful.

00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:39.956
Wenjin.

00:11:41.916 --> 00:11:42.715
Wenjin.

00:11:45.556 --> 00:11:46.475
Wenjin.

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:53.835
Zhang, what are you doing here?

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.995
Zhang, why are you spacing out?

00:11:57.995 --> 00:11:58.875
We're all waiting.

00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:04.720
Hey! Hey!

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:09.755
Sanxing.

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:14.556
Sanxing!

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.432
- Sanxing.
- Sanxing!

00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:17.796
Why is Sanxing here?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.208
Sanxing.

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:23.152
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing, what's wrong?

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:24.624
What are you doing, Sanxing?

00:12:25.156 --> 00:12:26.076
- Sanxing, stop!
- Sanxing, stop running.

00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:26.875
- Stop!
- Sanxing.

00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:28.156
Sanxing, what are you doing?

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:30.676
Sanxing!

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:32.115
Sanxing, stop running!

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:34.276
Stop running.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.676
Sanxing, stop!

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:38.595
Stop there!

00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:39.792
Hey! Sanxing!

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:40.784
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing!

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.936
Stop!

00:12:42.316 --> 00:12:43.920
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing!

00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:47.515
Where is he?

00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:49.556
Where is he?

00:12:57.316 --> 00:12:58.595
Sanxing is gone.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.016
(The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.
Enter to obtain paradise.)

00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:22.956
Eight hidden doors.

00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:25.036
This is the Esoteric Arts.

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:29.796
Opening Gate.

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:32.156
Rest Gate.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:33.835
Life Gate.

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:35.475
Death Gate.

00:14:36.995 --> 00:14:37.676
Obstruction Gate.

00:14:39.036 --> 00:14:39.875
Scenery Gate.

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:42.115
Injury Gate.

00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:43.835
Fear Gate.

00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:47.475
The Life Gate offers survival.

00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:49.076
The Death Gate brings doom.

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:52.556
Entering other gates

00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:54.676
will endlessly loop

00:14:55.635 --> 00:14:56.715
the eight gates.

00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:04.715
Huo Ling, don't.

00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:06.355
If we choose wrong,

00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:10.355
we might be trapped forever.

00:15:11.316 --> 00:15:12.796
Or even die in there.

00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:19.796
Which gate did Sanxing take?

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:21.916
I'm not sure.

00:15:24.036 --> 00:15:25.995
He was acting so strange,

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:28.076
as if a female ghost possessed him.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.316
Zhang, what are you doing?

00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:01.115
If there's truly a female ghost here,

00:16:02.276 --> 00:16:03.475
then this ghost

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:06.036
might be the owner of this tomb.

00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:09.835
In that case,

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.276
the gate Sanxing entered

00:16:12.916 --> 00:16:14.276
could be the Life Gate.

00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:20.875
Sanxing was combing his hair here?

00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:23.396
A guy combing his hair?

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:25.676
Didn't Wenjin say he was possessed

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:26.835
by a female ghost?

00:16:27.316 --> 00:16:28.036
A female ghost?

00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:28.715
Nonsense.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.156
He must've seen something inside

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:34.715
and had to comb his hair to see clearly.

00:16:34.715 --> 00:16:35.316
Combing hair?

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.235
Like this?

00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:40.156
Lower your head.

00:16:42.156 --> 00:16:43.196
Tilt sideways.

00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:44.835
I don't see anything.

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:46.036
Turn your face slightly.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:47.715
Is the posture wrong?

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.036
Try lowering your chin.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:50.755
What's going on?

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:51.916
What am I doing wrong?

00:16:53.475 --> 00:16:55.036
He was more feminine than you.

00:18:31.315 --> 00:18:32.196
Sanxing.

00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:36.755
Wu Sanxing.

00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:44.116
If he's truly possessed,

00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:46.156
following him could be dangerous.

00:18:52.515 --> 00:18:53.715
I'll look for him alone.

00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:54.755
Head back and wait.

00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:57.156
If I don't return in half an hour,

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.876
send reinforcements.

00:18:59.035 --> 00:18:59.436
But...

00:18:59.436 --> 00:19:00.636
How can we do that?

00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:02.196
We won't abandon you here.

00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:03.555
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:19:03.555 --> 00:19:04.475
I'll go with you.

00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:06.676
Me, too.

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:07.676
Me, too.

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.596
It's too dangerous. Let's all stay.

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:11.156
Let's go.

00:19:11.156 --> 00:19:12.396
What's so dangerous?

00:19:12.396 --> 00:19:13.315
But what if...

00:19:13.475 --> 00:19:14.555
No "what ifs".

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:15.156
We're all here.

00:19:15.636 --> 00:19:17.035
There's nothing scary.

00:19:17.035 --> 00:19:17.995
We have Chen Wenjin.

00:19:17.995 --> 00:19:18.836
Don't be afraid.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.596
Do you smell fragrance?

00:19:24.916 --> 00:19:25.356
Yeah.

00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:27.275
And it's growing stronger.

00:19:27.275 --> 00:19:27.795
Wenjin.

00:20:23.715 --> 00:20:24.876
(When I woke up,)

00:20:25.436 --> 00:20:27.715
(I found myself in a hospital bed.)

00:20:28.475 --> 00:20:29.636
(No memories.)

00:20:30.035 --> 00:20:31.075
(Utterly clueless.)

00:20:36.275 --> 00:20:37.755
(Months later,)

00:20:38.116 --> 00:20:40.396
(scattered memories resurfaced.)

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:48.995
(I remembered Chen Wenjin,
Huo Ling, and the others,)

00:20:49.995 --> 00:20:51.876
(but no concrete details.)

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:09.075
What I can say is that

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:10.555
for twenty years,

00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:12.596
I've been trying to find them.

00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:14.075
No clues surfaced.

00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:17.916
Three months ago,
I met your third uncle.

00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:20.196
He looked familiar.

00:21:20.876 --> 00:21:21.715
After that,

00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:23.396
I joined your kiln expedition.

00:21:24.156 --> 00:21:25.116
There, I realized

00:21:26.196 --> 00:21:27.436
he was hiding something.

00:21:30.995 --> 00:21:33.715
King Shang of Lu
and the silk manuscript were fake.

00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:35.396
Your third uncle swapped it out.

00:21:35.755 --> 00:21:36.436
Nonsense.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.035
Xiaoge

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:39.876
could've easily

00:21:40.596 --> 00:21:41.795
killed that blood corpse,

00:21:41.795 --> 00:21:42.956
so why did he keep running

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:44.116
and running?

00:21:44.475 --> 00:21:45.636
He was trying

00:21:45.836 --> 00:21:47.356
to ditch us.

00:21:48.196 --> 00:21:49.436
You swapped it.

00:21:50.035 --> 00:21:50.795
No, I didn't.

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:52.596
Your third uncle did it.

00:21:53.356 --> 00:21:55.475
He and Da Kui dug their way up
from under the tree.

00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:56.755
Maybe he dug

00:21:56.755 --> 00:21:58.475
behind the tree

00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:01.356
straight to the coffin's base.

00:22:06.436 --> 00:22:07.116
Da Kui!

00:22:07.116 --> 00:22:07.795
Maybe

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:09.916
that's why Da Kui had to die.

00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:13.275
Da Kui!

00:22:14.795 --> 00:22:16.396
(Throughout this journey,)

00:22:16.396 --> 00:22:17.936
(Sanxing's contributions to the team)

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.856
(were far more crucial
than my role as captain.)

00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:21.515
(Yet regarding Sanxing,)

00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:22.956
(I sometimes feel)

00:22:22.956 --> 00:22:24.275
(he is so enigmatic.)

00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:26.916
No.

00:22:27.436 --> 00:22:28.555
This doesn't add up.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.836
Third Uncle has no motive.

00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:32.396
Why would he do this?

00:22:33.995 --> 00:22:35.475
If he's truly your third uncle,

00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:36.956
then he has no motive.

00:22:38.636 --> 00:22:39.315
But...

00:22:44.356 --> 00:22:44.995
Third Uncle.

00:22:45.116 --> 00:22:46.275
Take me with you.

00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:48.715
I've read Grandpa's notebook
so many times.

00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:49.676
I'm so curious.

00:22:49.836 --> 00:22:50.956
Call your dad first.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:52.715
If he approves, I'll take you.

00:22:52.995 --> 00:22:54.995
Let's see if he'll break your legs.

00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:56.560
How will you walk without legs?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.156
Come on. Want me to call him?

00:22:59.275 --> 00:23:00.715
As a Wu,

00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:02.356
you gave up so easily?

00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:04.196
Seems like

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.475
you didn't really want to go anyway.

00:23:07.116 --> 00:23:08.156
You'll take me?

00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:10.235
You'll follow my lead.

00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:31.636
Truth is, many people

00:23:31.636 --> 00:23:34.676
in this world are clueless
about who they are.

00:23:36.876 --> 00:23:37.515
Have you ever

00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:39.396
thought that you might not be Wu Xie?

00:23:42.916 --> 00:23:44.555
This is too complicated.

00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:47.916
Too many unanswered questions.

00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.116
I can't verify anything
when Third Uncle is missing.

00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:56.396
The top priority

00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:57.836
is to find our way out.

00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:00.035
Once I'm out,

00:24:00.156 --> 00:24:02.235
I'll get to the bottom of this.

00:24:02.235 --> 00:24:06.436
♪Su San leaves Hongtong County♪

00:24:07.035 --> 00:24:10.515
♪Appearing on the bustling street♪

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:12.356
Pangzi.

00:24:12.475 --> 00:24:13.596
What's your problem?

00:24:13.596 --> 00:24:14.596
Be quiet, okay?

00:24:14.636 --> 00:24:18.196
I am combing my hair.

00:24:18.196 --> 00:24:20.475
Why do you care?

00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:21.836
Cut the yapping.

00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:24.596
You want to visit
that heavenly palace, too?

00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:28.156
Let me ask you one thing.

00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:32.035
After all our time here,

00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:34.356
have you found the path
to the top of the ship?

00:24:35.075 --> 00:24:37.315
I have.

00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.515
It's hidden in this inscription.

00:24:40.876 --> 00:24:43.636
The fated shall see

00:24:43.636 --> 00:24:45.235
the Heavenly Gate.

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.035
Enter

00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:47.995
to obtain paradise.

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:52.676
What's paradise?

00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:56.555
That heavenly palace counts as paradise.

00:24:58.075 --> 00:25:01.156
But it can't be underground.

00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:04.515
Thus, I conclude

00:25:04.515 --> 00:25:08.396
it's near the ship's highest point.

00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:15.755
You have a good point this time.

00:25:15.995 --> 00:25:18.956
I've always had a good point.

00:25:21.196 --> 00:25:22.916
To reach the heavenly palace,

00:25:23.515 --> 00:25:25.315
we must find the Life Gate first,

00:25:26.596 --> 00:25:28.436
which requires us to comb our hair.

00:25:32.075 --> 00:25:33.275
Xiaoge.

00:25:33.396 --> 00:25:35.315
You've been here before.

00:25:35.315 --> 00:25:37.275
Do you remember which door it was?

00:25:45.035 --> 00:25:46.035
This one.

00:25:48.396 --> 00:25:49.196
Don't enter yet.

00:25:50.755 --> 00:25:54.156
The Esoteric Arts work like elevators.

00:25:57.275 --> 00:25:58.596
You're saying

00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:02.475
that the eight doors shift randomly

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:05.196
like a revolving restaurant.

00:26:07.035 --> 00:26:09.315
So the central stele

00:26:09.676 --> 00:26:10.876
must house a mechanism

00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:13.436
synchronized with the wall rotation.

00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:16.836
The mark's position corresponds

00:26:17.235 --> 00:26:19.156
to the so-called Heavenly Gate.

00:26:56.636 --> 00:26:57.755
(Third Uncle.)

00:26:59.156 --> 00:27:00.836
(What happened back then?)

00:27:51.876 --> 00:27:53.755
What did you just see?

00:27:54.555 --> 00:27:55.436
I was combing my hair.

00:27:55.436 --> 00:27:56.795
Why didn't I see anything?

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:59.475
Three fish connected head-to-tail.

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:01.235
What fish?

00:28:09.836 --> 00:28:12.555
You think this pitch-black tunnel

00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:14.916
leads all the way to shore?

00:28:17.936 --> 00:28:19.196
Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

00:28:25.596 --> 00:28:26.515
Your Third Uncle

00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:28.275
found these
in that dead teammate's hand?

00:28:30.636 --> 00:28:32.156
Why are there two of them?

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:34.636
Do you have to be so stingy?

00:28:35.596 --> 00:28:36.676
The King of Lu's kiln.

00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:38.156
We took a box

00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:39.515
from the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse

00:28:39.515 --> 00:28:40.995
back there, remember?

00:28:41.116 --> 00:28:42.555
The same one you hit me with.

00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:44.676
Yeah.

00:28:46.755 --> 00:28:47.836
You brat.

00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:49.196
Why didn't you tell me

00:28:49.196 --> 00:28:50.075
you opened that box?

00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:52.396
This fish might be some kind of key.

00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:54.596
Had I known it was a key,
I would've taken it out.

00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:56.315
It was a mess back there.

00:28:56.315 --> 00:28:57.515
How could I remember that?

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:58.676
Fine.

00:28:58.916 --> 00:28:59.636
I'll let it slide.

00:29:02.676 --> 00:29:05.755
This shipwreck is so far
from the King of Lu's kiln.

00:29:06.715 --> 00:29:08.436
But let's put it aside.

00:29:09.035 --> 00:29:11.876
They're over 1000 years apart in age.

00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:13.916
That's what I thought, too.

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:15.636
But remember

00:29:15.636 --> 00:29:17.315
the mechanisms at the King of Lu's kiln?

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.396
Even then, I felt

00:29:19.515 --> 00:29:21.275
their craftsmanship
was too sophisticated

00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:23.596
for people dating back 1000 years.

00:29:24.436 --> 00:29:25.275
Now it seems

00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:27.075
that master craftsman Wang Zanghai

00:29:27.235 --> 00:29:28.636
may have visited the kiln

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:30.836
and modified its mechanisms.

00:29:31.156 --> 00:29:31.916
He might have put

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.515
the Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fishes there.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:35.436
Judging by the fish pattern

00:29:35.436 --> 00:29:36.515
on the gate,

00:29:36.715 --> 00:29:39.116
there should be
a third Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

00:29:40.436 --> 00:29:41.755
A third one?

00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:45.116
What does the fish stand for?

00:29:48.275 --> 00:29:49.116
What are you doing?

00:29:49.715 --> 00:29:50.596
Let's go.

00:29:51.676 --> 00:29:52.876
What's wrong?

00:29:54.235 --> 00:29:55.075
Pangzi.

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.235
These walls

00:29:57.436 --> 00:29:58.515
are closing in.

00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:05.275
Really.

00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:12.196
We're out of time.

00:30:12.356 --> 00:30:13.035
Run.

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:15.676
Run!

00:30:17.676 --> 00:30:18.555
Wait for me.

00:30:23.436 --> 00:30:24.515
Hurry, Pangzi.

00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:28.315
Slow down, you two.

00:30:28.636 --> 00:30:29.636
Wait for me.
