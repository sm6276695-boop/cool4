Wan is your biological daughter.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.360
It's really Wan!

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.600
Wonderful!

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
It's Wan!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.360
But I haven't told her yet.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.880
Don't. At least not now.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.400
Mother.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.200
How is Miss Yu?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.760
She's much better.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.440
Would you like to see her?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.000
Yes, I'll check on her.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.560
Qiming, it's late now.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.640
Let Miss Yu rest early.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.040
I'll just check on her and leave soon.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.680
Qiming, don't forget

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.920
she's now the City Lord's wife.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.680
Mother, I know.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.320
I'm just bringing her some food.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.280
Don't think

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.240
I don't know what you're thinking about.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.440
Stop embarrassing me!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.080
Mother, why do you say that?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.480
From now on,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.040
stop pursuing Miss Yu.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.360
Just give up on her!

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.880
Mother.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.720
You approved of her

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.360
and encouraged me to pursue her before.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.880
You wanted me to pursue her,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.800
then I had to.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.680
Now you ask me

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.720
to give up on her?

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.560
Why?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.480
Miss Yu is your elder sister.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.480
Mother.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.080
What did you say?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.600
Miss Yu is my Baozhu,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.400
my daughter,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.280
your biological sister.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.560
Mother.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.280
You're lying, right?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.880
Tell me you're lying.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.160
Mother, tell me you're lying.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.640
Qiming! Qiming!

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.520
Liar!

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.240
Qiming!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.440
Liar! You are all liars!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.920
Qiming!

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.640
- Qiming.
- City Lord!

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520
Let him go.

00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:35.848
Your time has come!

00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:53.297
Lady! Lady!

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.560
Yunqing.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960
Why are you here?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.200
Yuanbao said you were practicing here,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.760
and I brought you an outer robe.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.240
I've made soup.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.480
Come home for some.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.840
Alright, as you wish.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.048
(Shili Pavilion)

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.320
Mr. Song.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.520
Let me toast you.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.800
Here!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.000
- A toast to you, Mr. Song!
- Tonight, we drink until...

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.960
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.560
we drop!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.680
Mr. Song.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.000
Are you okay?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.120
Mr. Song, are you okay?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Two more cups?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.840
You're so beautiful,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.680
just like her.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.320
Mr. Song, who is she?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.320
It's... She...

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.760
Everyone out!

00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:24.864
Yes.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.680
Why are you leaving?

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.880
Qiming! Stop running wild.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.480
I'm not.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.720
I just

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.160
feel upset.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.080
She's your sister.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.640
That's a solid fact.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.840
You shouldn't have given birth to me,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.720
then I wouldn't be suffering like this!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.400
You...

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.440
Qiming! Qiming!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.880
I'm tired.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.840
Please go back.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.720
Qiming, do you resent me?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.480
I can't tell

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.920
whether I resent you,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.760
or I resent myself.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.680
Wan, you must be exhausted.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.400
Have an orange.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.520
No.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.600
Then you must want grapes!

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.160
No, you eat them.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.320
How about some tea?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.080
No.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.760
I know you're worried about my health.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.320
Look, I'm perfectly fine.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000
I feel happy in making money.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.840
Let me calculate

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.280
how much I earned yesterday.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.400
You're so busy.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.640
I feel terrible.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.880
I'll give you anything.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.360
Just talk to me.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.680
Be good. I'll talk to you tonight.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.440
But I can't wait until night.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.960
Mr. Song, what brings you here?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.920
Mr. Song. Long time no see.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.560
Long time no see.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.360
I'll go buy

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.840
some apricots.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.760
We have plenty of fruit.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.480
Mu Yunqing has been acting so strangely.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.400
Mr. Song, please sit.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.280
Miss Yu, are you feeling better?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.000
Much better.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.040
Full of energy now.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.920
Does he treat you well?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.720
He treats me great.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.720
Just needs some adaptation.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.200
Good.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.440
I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.680
How have you been lately, Mr. Song?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.560
Very well.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.240
What brings you here today?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.800
Just to check on you.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.560
If City Lord ever mistreats you,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.440
tell me and I'll deal with him.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.520
No need. I can deal with him myself.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.720
Thank you, Mr. Song.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.280
I'll take my leave now.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.720
Mr. Song.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:00.880
Thank you.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.280
(I hope you can always)

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.760
(be happy.)

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.400
(My sister.)

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.320
Husband.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.960
Is this too cruel for Qiming?

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.880
I also feel pitiful for Qiming.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.240
But only he can

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.400
overcome this obstacle himself.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.080
Fate plays cruel tricks.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.400
If he truly understands,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.000
I'll never force him

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.680
to help me avenge you.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.960
I'll let him live as he desires.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.440
Mother.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.320
Rest assured.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.760
From now on,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.400
I can only be Yu Yingwan's brother.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.320
And I'll never forget avenging Father.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.760
Mobei will pay for what they did.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.920
Qiming, I've wronged you.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
Though we've found your sister,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.320
I feel I've failed you.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.760
You shouldn't bear such cruel reality.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.120
Mother, actually,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.560
I've always wanted to meet my sister.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.560
Today my wish came true.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.280
I'm happy

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.760
we found her at last.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.560
She must be happy too.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.440
The City Lord's Mansion just sent word,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680
saying your sister is pregnant.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.480
From now on, we must

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.200
care for your sister,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.960
and the child she carries.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.320
I know what to do.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.680
Qiming, I know you feel upset.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.800
But this is what life is.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.200
Qiming, you have a long road ahead.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.320
I believe you'll finally clarify this

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.800
and find your own happiness.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.080
Mother, I understand.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.880
Rest assured.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.040
I'll treat my sister well.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.480
Trust me.
