Detective, do you want Yun Dong Hee to get better?

00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:47.265
Just enough to be coherent.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.065
Because I have a ton of questions for him.

00:04:54.105 --> 00:04:55.205
Mr. Shin.

00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:01.545
At the time, I was certain about my investigation.

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.675
Even though it made me look like a conspiracy nut in the end.

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:07.785
I mean, I'm not saying...

00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:11.555
it was unfair or anything.

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:13.455
I should get going.

00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:15.055
Mr. Shin.

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:19.225
I'm sorry.

It's not your fault, Detective Choi.

- Can I see your ID, please? - I already told you I forgot my ID.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.435
You can't come in without an ID, sir.

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:01.835
- Stop it. - You need to leave.

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:05.705
Honey, we're making a scene. Let's not embarrass him.

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:07.105
Let's just go home.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:10.815
Why can't a father see his own son? Come on, let's go in.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.445
I said, you can't enter without an ID. You need to leave now!

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:19.185
- Honey, just take this. - This is so embarrassing.

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:20.725
Excuse me.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.625
By any chance, are you Judge Cho Pillip's parents?

00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:26.995
- Oh, yes, we are. - Hello.

00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:28.065
Hello.

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:30.835
I'm sorry, have we met before?

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:34.565

(Court)

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:50.115
No wonder Judge Cho is so good. He takes after his parents.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:53.955
Well, our Judge Cho is a spitting image of me.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:56.895
- Mom? Father? - Oh, Pillip!

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:59.095
- Hello, sir. - Hey, come sit down.

00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:00.765
Oh, no, it's fine. I've got it.

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:06.805
What are you two doing here without calling?

00:07:06.865 --> 00:07:09.205
Well, your aunt called this morning.

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.375
She said you work at a chicken place.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:15.405
Judges are incredibly busy.

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:16.745
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:20.445
Yes, that's right. Judges have a lot on their plates.

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:23.955
Exactly. And not everyone is cut out for that.

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:27.725
Judge Cho has only ever studied. He's never cooked a day in his life.

00:07:27.855 --> 00:07:30.055
He can't drive, so forget about making deliveries.

00:07:30.395 --> 00:07:34.125
Father. Judge Kim is busy, so let's go.

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:36.395
Not at all. I'm not busy.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.935
Gosh. Let's just go.

00:07:39.205 --> 00:07:40.335
I'll see you out.

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:43.805
Why didn't you tell us? That you're working with that judge.

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.805
Oh, I was going to tell you, but I've just been so swamped.

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:51.615
He was a sharp kid. He turned out great.

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.045
- Thank you. - Honey.

00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:57.685
We've taken up enough of their time. We should go.

00:07:57.755 --> 00:07:59.625
- Right, let's go. - Let go of me.

00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.455
- What's gotten into you? - I'll leave when I'm ready.

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.925
Just one last thing.

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:13.835
You must really love fried chicken, Your Honor.

00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:18.405
- Excuse me? - Your team eats chicken daily.

00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:22.775
So whenever Pillip comes home, the whole house reeks of chicken.

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:29.655
I see. I'll be mindful, and we'll have beef.

00:08:29.715 --> 00:08:33.225
- Oh, that's not what I meant. - I'm taking the picture now.

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:36.455
One, two, three!

00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:41.565
- Have you eaten, sir? - Are you not eating?

00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:43.365
- I did. - You did?

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:45.695
Working hard, are we?

00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:48.635
I'm sorry, sir.

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:50.205
At least you know you should be.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:52.105
Yes. My father...

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:55.575
insisted I send a proof shot to my aunt.

00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:57.115
Why'd you have to drag your parents into it?

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.245
It was good to see them. It's been too long.

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:01.285
So then,

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:04.255
what did I do wrong now?

00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:08.855
What did I tell you on your first day?

00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:11.925
To become a good judge,

00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:14.595
you must first become a good person.

00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:18.065
- And? - Work hard. You have much to learn.

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:19.865
- And? - This place has great chicken.

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:21.305
It won't be a bad place to work.

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:25.575
- Not that. - Mr. Shin is eccentric,

00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:26.875
but he's good at the job.

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:30.575
I think that was the last thing you said.

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:33.515
Right. Mr. Shin is eccentric.

00:09:33.985 --> 00:09:35.385
He bends the rules instead of following them.

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:39.625
You're the one who told me he breaks the law without a thought.

00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:42.125
And now, you're letting him rub off on you?

00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:44.195
Me, sir?

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:46.525
What's Article 7, Section 2 of the Judicial Code of Ethics?

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.465
A judge must not join an organization...

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.665
with political objectives,

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:54.305
nor engage in election campaigns or compromise their neutrality.

00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:57.575
I wasn't campaigning.

00:09:58.675 --> 00:10:01.405
That crook on TV, Choi Woong Sik or whatever,

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:03.975
you said you wanted him to lose the election.

00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.885
No, but I didn't directly campaign against him.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:10.215
I only found evidence of his illegal activities.

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:13.385
Hanging out with Mr. Shin has made you a real smooth talker.

00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:19.425
Is that a compliment?

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:26.535
Follow me.

00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:33.675
I sent you there to learn how to be a real judge.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:37.575
Not some book-smart elitist in a robe...

00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:41.085
but a real judge who can see cases from the people's perspective.

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:43.985
But instead, you get caught on video next to an election candidate.

00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:45.415
That's a misunderstanding.

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:47.925
Due to a false food poisoning claim, MFDS and Kkokkio came, so...

00:10:49.055 --> 00:10:52.155
You should avoid all appearances of impropriety.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.435
- Yes, sir. - You've worked hard with Mr. Shin.

00:10:56.835 --> 00:10:58.065
It's time to come back now.

00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:01.065
You mean, right away?

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:02.365
Why?

00:11:03.175 --> 00:11:04.175
Don't you want to?

00:11:05.235 --> 00:11:08.905
No, it's not that. You said I need to approach the case...

00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:10.015
from the perspective of the public.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:13.815
I still lack practical experience and... Well...

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:16.985
And Mr. Shin is now teaching me the art of negotiation.

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:20.925
And that's a skill that's essential for mediating cases in the future.

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:22.085
Don’t stutter.

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:23.955
What's your point?

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:25.925
I'd like to train under him...

00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:30.365
for just two more months.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.065
Two months?

If only I hadn't backed down at the last minute.

You would've lost again anyway.

What are you talking about?

00:11:58.025 --> 00:12:00.925
Choi Woong Sik went to jail, so I was a shoo-in this time.

00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:04.865
Running for office again and again is its own kind of addiction.

You've spent enough on campaigns to buy this laundromat easily.

What? And what about you?

00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:13.745
You don't even run. So why didn't you buy yours?

00:12:13.745 --> 00:12:15.475
- What did you say? - Give me that!

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:16.875
Give it back!

Why isn't she coming out?

00:13:53.275 --> 00:13:54.975
Did you find anything on Kim Yong Woo?

00:13:55.505 --> 00:14:00.015
Nothing's in Kim Yong Woo's name. Not his phone, house, or accounts.

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:04.155
He's probably using a burner phone or someone else's name.

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:09.255
He's so shameless, he could get away with even more.

00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:13.125
Is Mr. Shin from then Jun's father?

00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:17.265
Yes. If it weren't for Mr. Shin,

00:14:18.235 --> 00:14:22.005
Ji Woo and Joon's fates could have been switched.

00:28:57.315 --> 00:28:59.415
But how am I supposed to ask him?

00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:01.415
"Mr. Shin, are you married?"

00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:05.215
No, that's not it. "Mr. Shin, do you have children?"

00:29:05.755 --> 00:29:07.015
That's even worse.

00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:09.685
"Why did you go drinking with Judge Kim?"

00:29:11.095 --> 00:29:12.155
I have no idea.

00:29:13.695 --> 00:29:16.495
If you're curious, ask him yourself.

00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:21.665
What's up? Did something good happen?

00:29:23.065 --> 00:29:25.175
Why are you staring at that wall like you're in love with it?

00:29:26.805 --> 00:29:28.975
Why so jumpy?

00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:30.975
Did you squeeze him for that commission?

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:34.815
- Commission? - The old man asked us to work.

00:29:39.885 --> 00:29:40.985
Aren't you coming?

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:42.655
Oh, coming!

00:29:48.795 --> 00:29:51.595
Why are we here? Shouldn't we meet the parties first?

00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:56.035
It's a lawsuit between friends. They know each other inside and out.

00:29:56.105 --> 00:29:57.775
We're at an overwhelming disadvantage.

00:29:58.605 --> 00:30:00.235
The key to any negotiation...

00:30:01.105 --> 00:30:03.175
isn't what you say, it's what you know.

00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:05.945
Are you any good with a camera?

00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:08.285
Of course. Want me to take one for you?

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:10.485
Forget it. Just play your part.

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:25.435
Not all of the kids here are orphans.

00:30:25.965 --> 00:30:27.235
"I'll be back in a month."

00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:28.905
"Just stay for a year."

00:30:29.365 --> 00:30:31.675
But they never come back, so this is their home.

00:30:33.705 --> 00:30:35.475
What about Baek Seung Mu and Ko Jae Kyung?

00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:38.875
Oh, Jae Kyung doesn't have parents,

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:41.985
and Seung Mu's mother left him here when he was seven.

00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:44.715
They both aged out of our care and left to live on their own.

00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:47.015
Were the two of them close?

00:30:48.185 --> 00:30:50.755
Oh, yes. People used to ask if they were blood brothers.

00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:54.265
I remember when Seung Mu first arrived.

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:57.095
He wouldn't eat or say a word.

00:30:57.465 --> 00:31:01.605
Whenever he got upset, he'd hide in the corner and stay.

00:31:01.765 --> 00:31:03.005
Seung Mu!

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:07.275
Seung Mu.

00:31:09.275 --> 00:31:11.115
Found you. Now I'm...

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:12.715
coming in.

00:31:14.115 --> 00:31:17.585
When I'd check on them later, I'd see them playing together inside.

00:31:21.885 --> 00:31:23.455
To think those cute kids are all grown up now.

00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:26.595
Not too long ago, Jae Kyung brought his girlfriend to visit.

00:31:26.825 --> 00:31:30.495
And Seung Mu reconnected with his mom and moved into her building.

00:31:30.565 --> 00:31:32.535
Oh, Jae Kyung lives in the same apartment building too.

00:31:32.665 --> 00:31:34.465
- The same building? - Yes.

00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:36.665
By the way...

00:31:37.305 --> 00:31:41.575
which paper did you say you're from? I'm afraid I don't recall.

00:31:42.175 --> 00:31:43.845
We're just a small publication,

00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:46.045
so people tend to forget about us.

00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:47.515
Hey, Reporter Jo.

00:31:48.045 --> 00:31:49.785
When the article comes out, send it to her right away.

00:31:50.385 --> 00:31:51.385
Will do.

00:31:55.285 --> 00:31:56.555
What a shame.

00:31:56.885 --> 00:31:58.555
A friendship torn apart over a security deposit.

00:31:58.955 --> 00:32:00.195
It's not torn apart yet.

00:32:01.325 --> 00:32:02.325
What makes you say that?

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:03.865
Didn't you hear them?

00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:07.095
They said they live in the same apartment building.

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:09.565
Well, that's just a fact.

00:32:10.635 --> 00:32:12.375
When Jae Kyung brought his girlfriend over,

00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:14.545
he must not have mentioned his problems with Seung Mu.

00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:15.945
He probably didn't want the director to worry.

00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:18.215
So what's the deciding factor in a negotiation?

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.145
Information, not words.

00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:23.185
I'm really glad we came here.

00:32:23.815 --> 00:32:26.155
You're being unusually agreeable today.

00:32:26.685 --> 00:32:28.985
What are you talking about? When have I ever been difficult?

00:32:29.055 --> 00:32:30.355
So how are things going with Si On?

00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:33.395
What are you talking about? It's not like that between us.

00:32:33.455 --> 00:32:35.895
I meant how is her GED prep going?

00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:37.365
Hit a nerve?

00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:39.865
I'm not being defensive.

00:32:39.895 --> 00:32:41.005
Hey, hold on.

00:32:41.605 --> 00:32:44.405
- Hey, I said let go so we can talk! - So what are you gonna do about it?

00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:46.435
- I told you I'd pay you back! - Darn it.

00:32:46.535 --> 00:32:48.945
You want to hit me? Go on, then. Hit me!

00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:50.005
You jerk!

00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:53.615
Hey, you're so dead. You hear me?

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:57.285
Go on, kill me! Hit me! Just do it! I wish I were dead.

00:32:57.755 --> 00:33:00.515
- I swear I will... - Hey, what are you doing?

00:33:00.585 --> 00:33:02.685
Watching the fight. Stay out of it.

00:33:02.825 --> 00:33:04.725
- Go on, kill me. Just do it. - Sir, you can't just...

00:33:04.955 --> 00:33:08.565
- I really do wish I were dead. - Oh, this is great.

00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:13.435
Don't mind me. Keep fighting.

00:33:13.765 --> 00:33:15.565
It was getting fun. Why did you stop?

00:33:15.705 --> 00:33:17.005
What's so great about this?

00:33:17.065 --> 00:33:21.305
Of course it's fun, my friend. If you can't enjoy a good fight,

00:33:21.605 --> 00:33:24.745
- what's the point of living? - Who says something like that?

00:33:27.445 --> 00:33:28.445
I do. What about it?

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:31.885
If you start a fight, you finish it.

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:35.885
It was just getting exciting. Man, what a buzzkill.

00:33:38.255 --> 00:33:40.355
Hey, you jerk! Baek Seung Mu, where are you going?

00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:43.595
Excuse me.

00:33:44.195 --> 00:33:45.265
Baek Seung Mu.

00:33:46.535 --> 00:33:47.535
And you must be Ko Jae Kyung?

00:33:52.175 --> 00:33:53.975
If you two are done fighting,

00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:56.145
I need to have a word with you.

00:34:00.574 --> 00:34:03.014
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

00:34:06.084 --> 00:34:08.784
Is this apartment building really in your name?

00:34:10.354 --> 00:34:15.224
Yes. It wasn't long after I aged out of the children's home.

00:34:15.624 --> 00:34:17.254
My mom contacted me.

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:20.624
She apologized for not being there and offered me this building.

00:34:22.134 --> 00:34:23.534
And your friend, Ko Jae Kyung...

00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:26.064
moved in with you at that time?

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.064
Yes.

00:34:27.534 --> 00:34:31.244
I was in public housing before that, but had to move when my aid ran out.

00:34:31.344 --> 00:34:33.874
Didn't you know the building was heavily mortgaged?

00:34:33.944 --> 00:34:37.644
I just found out. The agent said everything was fine.

00:34:38.014 --> 00:34:39.614
And since Seung Mu was the owner,

00:34:39.884 --> 00:34:43.254
I didn't suspect a thing. We're practically brothers.

00:34:43.914 --> 00:34:46.724
What did you do with the deposits you collected?

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.324
It was a pretty hefty sum.

00:34:48.594 --> 00:34:50.454
I honestly don't know.

00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:54.634
My mom handles all the money. I never even saw a cent of it.

00:34:54.694 --> 00:34:56.534
But Seung Mu is the landlord.

00:34:57.634 --> 00:34:59.134
He's not just some random person.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:02.404
We grew up in an orphanage together. We know exactly how hard it's been.

00:35:04.204 --> 00:35:05.304
This money...

00:35:06.004 --> 00:35:07.714
is everything to me.

00:35:09.144 --> 00:35:10.714
My wedding is in a month,

00:35:11.784 --> 00:35:13.314
and I still haven't been able to tell my fiancée.

00:35:13.384 --> 00:35:15.714
I never said I was going to stiff him.

00:35:15.984 --> 00:35:19.284
My mom invested it somewhere. She hasn't gotten it back yet,

00:35:19.354 --> 00:35:20.724
so I asked him to wait.

00:35:20.784 --> 00:35:24.864
He's said "soon" for six months! I was desperate, so I sued him.

00:35:25.394 --> 00:35:27.394
I can't even sleep. I just jolt awake,

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:30.764
and sometimes, I honestly just want to die.

00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:34.934
Do you know your mother's address?

00:35:36.604 --> 00:35:39.104
Yes. I have her address, but...

00:35:39.174 --> 00:35:40.644
I've never actually been there.

00:35:43.644 --> 00:35:45.314
(Haneul Apartments)

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:49.214
Ko Jae Kyung's apartment has only a single mattress.

00:35:49.284 --> 00:35:53.384
Baek Seung Mu had pill bottles, and his mood swings are extreme.

00:35:53.524 --> 00:35:55.654
Why does it feel like they're both victims?

00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:59.264
This whole thing spells trouble.

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:02.894
This is exactly why I can't stand that guy, Judge Kim. Seriously.

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.234
The judge is a good person. I'll work harder.

00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:09.674
Oh, would you look at that? Sticking up for your own, are we?

00:36:09.774 --> 00:36:13.344
- The legal cartel at its finest. - Excuse me?

00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:15.344
Unbelievable.

00:36:16.514 --> 00:36:18.544
(National Legal Medical Facility)

00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:36.434
You're back? You missed lunch. Where have you been?

00:36:36.934 --> 00:36:38.034
I'm on a diet.

00:36:38.704 --> 00:36:40.404
Does any of this make sense to you?

00:36:40.564 --> 00:36:41.574
What part?

00:36:41.604 --> 00:36:43.904
Since we started our investigation a month ago,

00:36:43.974 --> 00:36:45.304
the number of victims has actually gone up?

00:36:45.374 --> 00:36:47.844
That's because more and more leases are coming to an end.

00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:52.184
After meeting with that victim, I've decided to buy my own place.

00:36:52.314 --> 00:36:53.644
The whole thing just freaked me out.

00:36:53.914 --> 00:36:55.414
Must be nice. Buying your own place.

00:36:55.854 --> 00:36:59.554
- I need to get a loan first. - Must be nice, getting a loan.

00:37:00.224 --> 00:37:01.224
This is it.

00:37:10.564 --> 00:37:11.634
Looks like it's broken.

00:37:13.964 --> 00:37:16.374
Oh Mi Sook? Are you home?

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:17.604
(Bill payment notice)

00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:19.504
Oh Mi Sook? Are you in there?

00:37:19.574 --> 00:37:21.214
No one lives here. It's just a registered address.

00:37:21.544 --> 00:37:23.874
There are several months' worth of mail piled up.

00:37:28.254 --> 00:37:29.514
Oh Mi Sook!

00:37:29.854 --> 00:37:30.984
Anyone home?

00:37:39.264 --> 00:37:41.394
I seriously can't make heads or tails of this.

00:37:41.694 --> 00:37:45.004
Shouldn't this be written clearly to stop people from getting scammed?

00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:48.304
There's a senior collateral mortgage on the property,

00:37:48.374 --> 00:37:50.774
and all nine tenants are on rental deposit contracts.

00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:53.544
On top of that, ownership changed from Oh Mi Sook to Baek Seung Mu.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.074
It's a textbook rental deposit scam targeting a multi-family building.

00:37:56.144 --> 00:37:58.044
That's not how Baek Seung Mu sees it.

00:37:58.444 --> 00:38:01.854
He thinks he can repay the deposits when his mom's investment pays off.

00:38:01.914 --> 00:38:03.654
He's just naive enough to believe it.

00:38:04.484 --> 00:38:08.224
I know, right? It's obvious his mom framed him and skipped town.

00:38:08.294 --> 00:38:13.264
What mother abandons her son, and returns after 20 years for this?

00:38:13.394 --> 00:38:14.964
A monster of a mother.

00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:20.664
Well, she is awful. You're better off without her.

00:38:20.734 --> 00:38:21.934
It's better for the child's mental health.

00:38:22.274 --> 00:38:23.804
And another thing, not having a mom...

00:38:23.804 --> 00:38:25.404
doesn't make you pitiful or messed up.

00:38:26.174 --> 00:38:27.174
I mean, look at me.

00:38:29.844 --> 00:38:30.944
You're really something else.

00:38:36.084 --> 00:38:38.654
I'm just proud of you for solving those problems without nodding off.

00:38:44.924 --> 00:38:46.264
Hello, you've reached the fried chicken restaurant.

00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:48.334
That's it! That's it!

00:38:48.634 --> 00:38:49.864
You're here?

00:38:49.864 --> 00:38:51.104
Come on!

00:38:51.634 --> 00:38:54.404
Come on. Darn it.

00:38:54.474 --> 00:38:57.274
- You couldn't even hang in there? - You play video games?

00:38:58.304 --> 00:39:01.714
I was just killing time while waiting. So I played a bit.

00:39:01.814 --> 00:39:04.684
Hey, but listen.

00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:08.584
Where do you keep digging up these cases?

00:39:08.684 --> 00:39:11.284
You think I picked them? It was Judge Kim.

00:39:12.084 --> 00:39:15.594
Forget it. I'm allergic to court matters.

00:39:15.654 --> 00:39:17.094
Does Oh Mi Sook have a record too?

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:20.664
No, but the guy she's living with does.

00:39:20.824 --> 00:39:22.594
Three priors for real estate fraud.

00:39:22.864 --> 00:39:27.264
Besides that multi-family building she transferred to her son's name,

00:39:27.334 --> 00:39:30.234
she currently owns more than 10 other properties.

00:39:30.404 --> 00:39:33.644
Five of which are about to go to auction.

00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:36.844
- So the guy's a broker? - Exactly.

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:41.454
There are these investment groups joined by word-of-mouth,

00:39:41.514 --> 00:39:44.314
where they get tips on developments, sell properties,

00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:46.724
and find properties you can get without paying a premium.

00:39:46.854 --> 00:39:51.524
At first, they let you make a profit on little deals, bit by bit.

00:39:51.594 --> 00:39:54.894
But once you bite on a big one? They clean you out completely.

00:39:55.094 --> 00:39:57.564
Hey, get me in there.

00:39:57.904 --> 00:39:58.904
Darn it.

00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:02.774
What?

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:06.474
It's an exclusive group.

00:40:06.544 --> 00:40:10.414
- Stop dissing me, man. - You're too small-time.

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.184
Hey, Mr. Shin.

00:40:15.384 --> 00:40:17.614
Yes, Chairman Park. Where are you right now?

00:40:26.864 --> 00:40:28.334
Why are you waiting out here?

00:40:28.494 --> 00:40:31.634
His guest just left. He's waiting for you inside.

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:33.864
Okay.

00:40:45.844 --> 00:40:47.084
What are you staring at?

00:40:48.854 --> 00:40:49.854
Sir.

00:40:50.684 --> 00:40:53.524
You know that credit card you have. The black one.

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:56.494
- Yes? - A card like that has no limit?

00:40:56.694 --> 00:41:00.124
What do you mean, no limit? The limit is whatever I can afford.

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:03.964
Why? You need money? Running for the merchant association?

00:41:04.704 --> 00:41:09.574
That's way too small-time. I'm aiming for bigger fish this time.

00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:14.814
Sure. Do whatever you want.

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:18.484
Just run your business properly.

00:41:19.014 --> 00:41:20.414
And no more health inspections.

00:41:20.484 --> 00:41:23.584
What's the point, when you tell me not to make a profit?

00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:25.224
My costs are too high.

00:41:33.564 --> 00:41:35.534
- Have a safe trip home, sir. - Okay.

00:41:44.234 --> 00:41:45.244
Thank you.

00:41:49.344 --> 00:41:50.414
Madam Joo.

00:41:50.744 --> 00:41:52.814
Are you free tomorrow, by any chance?

00:41:53.114 --> 00:41:54.114
What for?

00:41:59.924 --> 00:42:01.994
The chairman wanted you to have this.

00:42:03.294 --> 00:42:04.294
Well...

00:42:04.694 --> 00:42:05.694
Thank you.

00:42:12.504 --> 00:42:15.174
He said be careful with the watch. It's a limited edition.

00:42:16.374 --> 00:42:17.404
Right, I will.

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:26.214
He's so full of himself.

00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:35.494
This watch is ridiculously fancy.

00:42:39.294 --> 00:42:41.964
Oh, right. Now, where were we?

00:42:43.464 --> 00:42:45.634
I'm free tomorrow.

00:42:46.504 --> 00:42:47.974
Perfect.

00:42:49.874 --> 00:42:53.404
- He's practically robbing me blind. - What on earth is he up to now?

00:42:53.474 --> 00:42:55.614
At least he's not moping around. What's the big deal?

00:42:56.614 --> 00:42:59.084
You're loaded, so I guess it's fine.

00:42:59.484 --> 00:43:01.714
Look at you, so generous with my money.

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:27.904
This doesn't look good on me, does it?

00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:30.674
What are you talking about? You look absolutely beautiful.

00:43:34.544 --> 00:43:35.984
Here, try this one on too.

00:43:36.284 --> 00:43:37.284
Come on.

00:44:15.654 --> 00:44:16.654
Everything's ready.

00:44:17.694 --> 00:44:19.564
- Shall we go? - Okay.

00:44:20.294 --> 00:44:23.434
I'll have the rest sent over. Just take this for now.

00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:34.074
I've never done any of this before.

00:44:34.144 --> 00:44:36.474
It was a first for me too, and I had a lot of fun.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.484
But you seemed like such a natural.

00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:42.454
I meant it's my first time shopping with someone like this.

00:44:44.284 --> 00:44:46.424
My daughter is about your age,

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:50.654
- but I've never done this with her. - Why not?

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.424
She moved abroad when she was little.

00:44:55.534 --> 00:44:57.764
But why do I need to go through all this?

00:44:57.834 --> 00:45:00.364
- Mr. Shin said it was for a date. - He did?

00:45:06.944 --> 00:45:08.714
- Glad you could make it. - Yes.

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:11.584
Mr. Lee.

00:45:12.014 --> 00:45:13.884
- How have you been? - Good to see you.

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.284
Thanks to you, I've made a fortune.

00:45:15.354 --> 00:45:16.614
Right. I'll swing by later.

00:45:28.794 --> 00:45:32.834
What area are you interested in? Redevelopment?

00:45:32.904 --> 00:45:35.234
Buildings? Or maybe auctions?

00:45:35.304 --> 00:45:39.104
No, I prefer something small-scale. Quick in, quick out.

00:45:39.344 --> 00:45:40.804
But in high volume.

00:45:42.344 --> 00:45:45.414
You think a lot like that gentleman over there with the glasses.

00:45:47.684 --> 00:45:51.624
I run a VIP group. I'll send you an invite.

00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:53.684
Just enter the password written here.

00:45:59.864 --> 00:46:01.694
You have my ID, right?

00:46:02.494 --> 00:46:06.904
Of course. Everyone here is verified,

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:09.604
so getting in early is a surefire way to make money.

00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:12.444
Thank you.

00:46:23.454 --> 00:46:24.684
They're meeting right now.

00:46:24.684 --> 00:46:27.724
(Si On: They're meeting right now.)

00:46:29.408 --> 00:46:30.708
(From Mr. Shin)

00:46:30.878 --> 00:46:33.908
Since Baek Seung Mu knows our faces, Si On, you go to the meeting place.

00:46:33.978 --> 00:46:37.178
When they split up, follow Oh Mi Sook, then meet Pillip.

00:46:37.278 --> 00:46:39.988
But, Mom, I told you Jae Kyung's getting married next month.

00:46:40.248 --> 00:46:42.088
It's for the deposit on their new place!

00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:47.228
I'm so ashamed that I can't even face you or Jae Kyung.

00:46:48.158 --> 00:46:51.668
I just called the investment firm. They said to wait one more week.

00:46:51.728 --> 00:46:54.028
They said if I pull out now, I'll lose 20 percent of the principal.

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.698
But you've been saying "just wait" for months now.

00:46:57.268 --> 00:47:01.738
This is killing me too. The market's awful, I'm losing money.

00:47:01.808 --> 00:47:04.308
Anyway, I'll get you the money next week.

00:47:05.108 --> 00:47:09.648
If I have to, I'll take out a loan to pay Jae Kyung's deposit first.

00:47:09.718 --> 00:47:10.818
I promise.

00:47:11.648 --> 00:47:15.318
- You mean it this time, right? - Of course I do.

00:47:16.888 --> 00:47:20.128
We'll go to Jae Kyung's wedding together.

00:47:20.358 --> 00:47:21.358
Okay?

00:47:23.858 --> 00:47:24.928
Let's go.

00:47:28.638 --> 00:47:29.738
Check, please.

00:47:34.308 --> 00:47:36.108
They're leaving the cafe now.

00:47:37.008 --> 00:47:39.078
- Get home safe! - Okay, you too.

00:47:47.718 --> 00:47:49.858
Seung Mu is blowing up my phone.

00:47:52.858 --> 00:47:54.488
I can't wait until the end of this week.

00:47:55.058 --> 00:47:58.728
I sent the documents this morning, so cash out and move our flight up.

00:48:08.238 --> 00:48:09.238
What are you doing?

00:48:09.908 --> 00:48:11.578
That woman already left.

00:48:18.148 --> 00:48:19.148
Are you coming or what?

00:48:27.688 --> 00:48:30.098
Where are you off to? Got plans tonight? A get-together?

00:48:30.158 --> 00:48:32.768
- What do you mean? I'm off to work. - Then why do you look so pretty?

00:48:34.198 --> 00:48:38.198
I know, right? I startled myself in the mirror.

00:48:38.338 --> 00:48:41.438
I was just so pretty. I barely recognized myself.

00:48:42.338 --> 00:48:44.838
No, I'm serious. Why are you all dolled up?

00:48:46.108 --> 00:48:47.108
It's for the date.

00:49:01.128 --> 00:49:02.128
Hey, you're here.

00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:06.928
- What's up? - I just saw my mom.

00:49:07.198 --> 00:49:11.138
She'll pay the deposit next week. She'll get a loan if she has to.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.868
Darn it. I'll believe it when I see it.

00:49:13.938 --> 00:49:14.938
It's not like this is the first time.

00:49:15.008 --> 00:49:16.278
She said she's really sorry.

00:49:16.538 --> 00:49:18.448
She wants to go to your wedding with me.

00:49:18.648 --> 00:49:19.648
For real this time?

00:49:20.908 --> 00:49:23.278
Yes. Listen, Jae Kyung.

00:49:24.218 --> 00:49:26.918
Please, just give her one more week.

00:49:27.148 --> 00:49:28.958
I'm sorry. My mom promised.

00:49:30.288 --> 00:49:32.628
Give me a break with the "my mom" excuses.

00:49:33.128 --> 00:49:35.058
Whatever. I should get back to work.

00:49:35.358 --> 00:49:37.998
- Hey, Jae Kyung, wait up. - What is it?

00:49:42.898 --> 00:49:43.898
Here, take this.

00:49:44.338 --> 00:49:46.808
It's 10,000 dollars. Put it toward the wedding.

00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:48.308
Where did you get this?

00:49:49.408 --> 00:49:53.008
My pay and my part-time job. I broke into my savings for the rest.

00:49:53.078 --> 00:49:55.318
Darn it, are you crazy? How are you going to get by?

00:49:55.378 --> 00:49:57.148
I'm a landlord.

00:49:58.278 --> 00:49:59.388
Go on.

00:49:59.818 --> 00:50:01.818
Hurry up and go. You said you were busy.

00:50:02.358 --> 00:50:03.358
All right, I'm going.

00:50:04.218 --> 00:50:05.228
Go on.

00:50:06.058 --> 00:50:07.088
Have a good shift.

00:50:27.178 --> 00:50:28.548
Go ahead.

00:50:28.978 --> 00:50:30.048
Okay.

00:50:32.588 --> 00:50:34.988
- Hello? - I'm dropping the lawsuit.

00:50:35.488 --> 00:50:36.488
Excuse me?

00:50:37.188 --> 00:50:38.288
Did you get the deposit?

00:50:38.588 --> 00:50:41.158
What? He's dropping the lawsuit without even getting the deposit?

00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:43.598
Yes. Apparently, Seung Mu's mom promised it for next week.

00:50:44.228 --> 00:50:46.468
Seriously? And he's naive enough to believe her again?

00:50:47.298 --> 00:50:49.898
Okay, I'll go meet with Ko Jae Kyung.

00:50:50.038 --> 00:50:51.568
Find out what Oh Mi Sook is up to.

00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:54.708
I'll call you back.

00:50:55.038 --> 00:50:57.478
Si On.

00:51:08.518 --> 00:51:11.218
Hey, you. What are you doing here? I saw you on the street earlier.

00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:12.758
Are you following me?

00:51:13.788 --> 00:51:15.258
Why would I be following you?

00:51:15.328 --> 00:51:17.558
You've been following me since before the intersection.

00:51:18.458 --> 00:51:19.468
Honey!

00:51:22.238 --> 00:51:23.538
What took you so long?

00:51:23.668 --> 00:51:26.438
I was on a call outside. Have you been waiting long?

00:51:29.108 --> 00:51:30.508
Oh, and you are?

00:51:30.908 --> 00:51:32.048
Do you know her?

00:51:32.648 --> 00:51:33.648
No.

00:51:34.278 --> 00:51:36.578
This lady keeps asking if I was following her.

00:51:36.878 --> 00:51:38.618
Do you have something to say to my girlfriend?

00:51:39.588 --> 00:51:41.088
I must have been mistaken.

00:51:42.488 --> 00:51:44.318
- Sorry about that. - Honey.

00:51:44.388 --> 00:51:45.388
Yes?

00:51:46.288 --> 00:51:47.288
What's wrong?

00:51:47.588 --> 00:51:48.658
It's nothing. Let's go.

00:51:52.868 --> 00:51:54.868
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:03.338
Your booking is until next weekend, but you'd like to check out early?

00:52:03.408 --> 00:52:06.578
- Yes, we'll check out tomorrow. - All right. Just a moment, please.

00:52:07.108 --> 00:52:09.948
- Do you have any rooms available? - Yes, ma'am. One moment, please.

00:52:10.918 --> 00:52:12.188
All right, you're all set.
