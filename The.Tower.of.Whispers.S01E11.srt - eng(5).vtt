[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.310
[Episode 11]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.520
My dear.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.150
Yingying

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.400
is over 18, right?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.850
She's already 20.
She is no longer a child.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.150
[Marriage Profile]

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.280
Shouldn't we start arranging

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.850
Yingying's marriage?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.680
Yes.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.190
[Marriage Profile]

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.000
Yes.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.930
Father, Mother, what's up?

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.240
Yingying.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.190
It occurs to me that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.150
from now on, my brother will be living
at the Longxiang Guard Command Center.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.610
Take a look at these first.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.090
Marriage profiles?

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.710
These are the marriage profiles of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.710
those talented and successful young men

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.800
around your age in the capital.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.170
Take your pick.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.960
If you find someone suitable,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.190
I'll send someone to arrange the match.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
No.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.560
I just want to stay with you two forever.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.120
Well...

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Silly child.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.120
People who come of age should get married.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.050
How could you stay with us forever?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.820
Just take a look first.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.190
Forget it if you don't want to
marry someone.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.750
However,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.870
your monthly allowance

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.520
will be cut in half.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.470
You always threaten me with that.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.400
Yingying, be good and listen to us.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.630
Take these and have a look.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.000
Go back, read these profiles

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.680
and pick someone carefully.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.910
Take a good look.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.040
You really want to choose someone, huh?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.960
I had no choice.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.800
My parents insisted that I choose someone

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.560
or they would reduce my allowance.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.960
If you don't want to do it,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.800
it's easy to solve this problem.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.520
What?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.200
You want to meet them?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.360
Don't tear them up! Give them back!

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.830
You want to keep them?

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.750
They can't be torn.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.920
We can't!

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.750
These marriage profiles were carefully

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.750
selected by my parents.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.149
How could we tear them up?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.160
I...

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.830
I just accidentally

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.290
threw them all into the fire
and burned them.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.240
[Lu's Mansion]

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.560
I accidentally threw

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.270
all those marriage profiles into the fire.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.310
I tried to retrieve them

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.920
but only got my hand burned.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.600
You...

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.630
Just as I expected.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.920
Today,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.120
I've invited all those talented young men

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.390
to come over.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.800
You can meet each of them

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.160
to get to know them all.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.830
It is more direct than
just reading their profiles.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.190
That's a bit too direct.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.070
It's not convenient to

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.240
have so many people at our house.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.950
You...

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.920
I have foresight, don't I?

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.160
With this large screen here,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.270
you can hear their voices

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.070
and see their silhouettes.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.680
But it's not a formal meeting.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.630
You can talk about

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.430
whatever you want.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.430
You're in such a hurry to marry me off?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.920
You've gone to great lengths.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.720
Alright, Yingying. Be good.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.580
Hurry up and go.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.120
Your father and I are free today.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.450
So, we'll go out for tea.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.510
Have a chat with them.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.430
My Lady, what should we do?

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.240
Do not talk with them.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.770
Let's go.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.390
Wait.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.040
It's better to solve it once
rather than keep avoiding it.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.920
Don't my parents want me to talk with them?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.240
Then I'll speak freely

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.830
and say everything that we women

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.800
want to say.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.430
I assume all of you

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.630
know something about my situation.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.930
So let me tell you my criteria for
choosing a husband.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.310
If you want to marry me,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.000
we should live in harmony,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.510
be understanding of each other,
and communicate on an equal footing.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.430
It's easy.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.510
Go on.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.640
Since we're equals,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.950
we should discuss matters together,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.310
make decisions together,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.390
and share household chores.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.950
It is too easy.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.830
Is she in a hurry to get married?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.770
Ridiculous!

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.070
Doing housework?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.600
Don't you know that gentlemen
should stay away from the kitchen?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.270
Do you want your husband to do dirty work,
Miss Lu?

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.070
Since you've read the classics,

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.240
you should know that
if one cannot clean his own house,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.000
he can't help govern the country.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.510
You...

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.750
I am not destined to be with Miss Lu.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.210
I'll take my leave now.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.510
Mr. Zhou, since you came here by carriage,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.630
could you give me a ride?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.240
Let's go. Let's go.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.920
Okay. Okay.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.310
Then I'll continue.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.600
My husband can't
have any concubines in his life.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.270
The first child born

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.510
must take my surname.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.360
Not taking concubines is already too much,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.750
and now the child must take her surname?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.240
There has never been such a rule
throughout history.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.830
That's right.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.830
-There has never been such a rule!
-Miss Lu is too domineering!

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.560
I'm leaving.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.930
I haven't finished yet.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.560
This last item is that

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.560
my husband can't keep me stuck at home

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.560
in the name of love.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.240
I have ambitions just like men.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.500
My husband must not
restrict my freedom.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.270
Miss Lu has such high demands.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.920
I would like to see

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.950
how beautiful you are.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.920
Let me see.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.790
Indeed, you are a beauty.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.490
Miss Lu, your features resemble someone.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.830
I remember now.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.800
You look like Honglian of
the Diecui Brothel.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.630
She is the newly crowned courtesan.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.430
It is said that it would only cost
a maximum of 100 taels of silver

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.560
to spend a night with her.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.480
Sir, you needn't
compare me with a courtesan

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.159
to insult me.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.600
Because I don't care.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.800
What's wrong with being a courtesan?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.120
If this is your understanding,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.520
why bother coming here?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.760
You just don't know
how to be a good wife.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.390
How dare you make such demands of men!

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.950
Yes. Exactly!

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.560
Ridiculous!

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.510
I'm merely asking for

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.310
loyalty and respect
from my future husband.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.950
But you think I'm being improper.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.000
What about all those demands

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.680
you put forward to the matchmaker?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.190
Can I say you're failing to
uphold male virtue?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:05.720
You...

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.800
All I want is

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.680
monogamy.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.070
Is that difficult?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.780
Wishful thinking.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.430
Who dares hit me?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.070
I think it was karma.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.630
I'd better not get involved with her.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.200
Let's go. Let's go.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.630
Let's get out of here.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.550
That's great, My Lady.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.120
They all left.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.580
What an impressive woman!

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.669
I'm still here.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.200
This way, Young Master.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.600
I think all of Miss Lu's demands

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.600
can be fulfilled.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
It's you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.790
Yingying,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.890
long time no see.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.200
Hong'an.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.270
I remember you were chubby
when you were young.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.440
That's right.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.080
I was often bullied because I was fat.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.910
You were the only one
who played with me.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.790
Do you remember that

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.150
we used to catch butterflies together.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.630
Yes. I loved butterflies.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.080
So we always tried to
catch butterflies together.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.790
But we were too clumsy.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.960
We never managed to catch one.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.840
So this time,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.170
I brought a butterfly especially for you.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.670
No, this is too valuable.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.670
I can't accept it.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.240
We're close.
So, do not talk about the value of it.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.360
A bracelet is an intimate item.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.750
You're just an outsider.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.240
How can you give her a bracelet casually?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.790
Who is this gentleman?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.000
I'm her bodyguard.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.870
He's Five.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.440
I'm also called Five.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.320
How could a decent guy be called Five.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.780
Isn't it a servant's name?

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.840
Five.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.980
This is for you.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.150
Anyway,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.840
I can't accept this bracelet.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.500
Please don't feel pressured.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.390
This is just a small gift

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.850
I'm giving you as a friend.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.790
Besides, if I'm going to
give you something,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.390
how could I possibly
just give you a butterfly?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.750
Five.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.620
Coming, Young Master.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.320
Young Master has prepared

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.440
a golden butterfly

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240
for everyone in Lu's Mansion.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.090
Well...

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:29.870
Well...

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.270
It will cost you too much.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.960
These are just....

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.360
Our Young Master is rich.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.870
He is the wealthiest man in the capital.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.130
You're too talkative.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.910
I'll slap myself.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.150
Stop. Stop.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.720
Stop.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.870
Give them away now.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:46.720
Well,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.750
one for each person.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.910
Soon, everyone in Lu's Mansion

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.120
will have a butterfly.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.360
Yingying will be happy to see that.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.440
Alright.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.960
If that's the case,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.000
thank you, Hong'an.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.510
I'll visit you another day

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.790
with gifts.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.650
Yingying, no need to be so polite.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.510
Yingying, can you help me up?

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.030
You have leg pain, right?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.960
Do you need me to set your bone?

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.600
Yingying.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.720
You scared him.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.840
This gentleman is feeling unwell.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.130
He should seek medical attention now.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.270
No need.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.240
I've arranged a dinner party.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.040
What about checking on my leg
after we have dinner?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.080
Okay.
