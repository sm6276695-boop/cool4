00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.010
Stop shouting!

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.220
I have to save my son!

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.670
I have to save my son!

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.120
Stop the truck!

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.070
Are you crazy?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.010
[Public Security]

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.600
Stop!

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.150
I have to save my son!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.600
Stop or I'll shoot!

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.100
I have to save my son!

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.480
[Public Security]

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.000
Stop!

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.840
[Police]

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.410
I have to save my son!

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.510
[Public Security]

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.480
Master Du.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.180
The cook killed Liu Libo.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.130
The cook is a ruthless character.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:45.730
Indeed.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.020
I'm sorry. This is a private area.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.380
Master Du.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.750
Mr. Tang.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.840
We suspect

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.510
you're involved in a drug deal.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.570
Please come with me for questioning.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.780
Could it be a mistake?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.910
Please.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.550
What I just saw must be the drug cook.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.910
Captain Luo, copy that.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.170
Liu Libo wasn't transporting ice at all.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.840
No wonder Tang Du hasn't made a move.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.240
Liu Libo is just a decoy.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.530
He must have other methods.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.130
The land route is just a cover

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.500
to divert all police forces.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.670
Could it be by sea?

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.650
By sea?

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.190
Well done.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.619
That was easy.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.349
Fireworks as the signal.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.270
A covert diversion tactic.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.580
So you're the cook.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.750
Yes.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.240
How's going on with my grandpa?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.840
Your grandpa is clean.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.460
He'll be back soon.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.240
Where're my men?

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.960
Out!

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.350
Where's Mou Lang?

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.150
After we verify the stuff,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.610
I'll release him.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.600
Didn't we agree—goods for
the men, fair trade?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.260
Your Xin Sheng He lot
really don't play by the rules.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.430
Let me show you

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.460
what rules really mean.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.190
We don't need your lessons!

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.780
If it weren't for Master Du today,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.390
you wouldn't be here.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.910
This shipment

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.600
is 3 years late.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.010
Do you know how much we've lost?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.690
You want to talk to me about rules?

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.450
Then let's

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.050
settle our accounts here.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.340
We've already delivered everything to you.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.820
You still won't let my brother go.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.790
Are you still going
to point that gun at me?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.920
If you shoot,
you'll never get any more stuff.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.400
Do you believe
I'll shoot you dead right now?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.200
Go ahead.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.890
Shoot me.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.530
Go ahead.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:37.960
Sen!

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.370
Calm down.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.330
I think Miss Tang is right.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.630
You don't understand the rules.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.430
It's my fault.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.590
Harmony leads to wealth.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.920
Harmony leads to wealth.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.320
Harmony leads to wealth.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.230
I'm sorry.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160
Let's go quickly.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.820
How many times have I told you?

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.670
What have I always told you?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.530
Let's go.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.650
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.960
Let's go.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.240
I'm sorry.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.280
Take care.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.680
I won't see you off.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.210
Get me a small boat quickly.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.130
My bag was left in the cabin.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.750
Didn't you come without a bag today?

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:26.950
Wait here for backup.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.850
Over here!

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.510
Hu!

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.570
Catch this!

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.330
There's nothing to be angry about.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.830
That woman

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.790
won't live to return to Xinji...

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.690
Her life is worthless.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.260
If it's worthless,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.130
then do not dwell on it anymore.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:17.990
Hey!

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.610
Something's not right.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.180
Ignore him.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.440
Let's sail!

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.800
What if it's the coast guard?

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.560
It is the coast guard.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.050
Go!

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.200
We can't keep this stuff.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:40.960
Take Miss Tang away first.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.760
A coast guard?

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:42.350
Yes.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.880
Let's go.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.320
Yu, let's go!

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.750
Get the boat ready to pick up Miss Tang.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.790
You take the boat and leave first.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:53.920
I'll draw them away.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.000
Take care of him.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.940
Meet at Xinji.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.750
Go!

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.760
Kill them all.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.160
This is China Coast Guard.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.010
Vessel ahead,
stop immediately for inspection.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.240
Vessel ahead,
stop immediately for inspection.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.680
This is China Coast Guard.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.410
Vessel ahead,
stop immediately for inspection.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.340
Vessel ahead,
stop immediately for inspection.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.960
Don't move!

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.230
Uncle Yang, are you okay?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.070
You've been shot?

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.500
Take it easy.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.570
Just a scratch. I'm fine.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.180
Where are you hurt?

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.000
I'm fine.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.510
So many?

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.070
This isn't right.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.850
Wasn't there an explosion before?

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.380
Why are there still so many?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.650
The color is different.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.870
The weight is wrong too.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.070
The one with this color is Braised Pork.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.820
It smells like rock sugar.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.120
If Mou Lang could come back,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.800
this plan would be perfect.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.530
You called the police, didn't you?

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.020
You never had 200 kilos of that stuff.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.320
To rescue you both,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.800
I had to take risks.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.430
The only one you really wanted
to save was your brother.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.530
You're different.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.980
But to me,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.530
both of you are important.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.680
Duozai.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.570
There's something I must tell you.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.510
Uncle Ma is in trouble.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:30.850
What happened?

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.110
He was transporting the stuff

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.190
when the police stopped him.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.040
Why would he be transporting the stuff?

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.370
Master Du demanded

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.050
to receive all the stuff

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.450
before letting both of you go.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.590
And he demanded

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.150
that each side send someone

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.480
to transport fake stuff

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.440
to

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.480
divert the police's attention.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.960
Uncle Ma went.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.110
He tried to run through a checkpoint
while transporting the stuff

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.840
and was shot dead by the police.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.660
You're lying.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.860
Are you kidding me?

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.870
What are you trying to get me
to do with these lies? Tell me.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.330
How would he have that kind of courage?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.920
He was clearly transporting fake stuff.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.580
Why would he run a checkpoint?

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.760
I don't know the details either.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.360
But Liu Libo was in the truck at the time.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.340
I suspect Liu Libo
forced him to run the checkpoint.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.190
Duozai.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:49.910
I'm sorry.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.250
I couldn't protect him.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.590
You forced me!

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.720
You forced him too!

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.030
You had to destroy my family

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.560
before you were satisfied?

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560
Are you happy now?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.540
Your father

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.750
came willingly.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.590
We didn't kidnap him.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.730
Willingly?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.450
Didn't you guys kidnap him?

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.400
Go ahead and kill me if you want!

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.210
Listen to me!

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.760
Let me tell you the truth.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.270
Your father didn't want you
to turn yourself in.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.330
Do you understand?

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.030
He put on an act.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.030
And let me tell you something.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.830
Don't you even know

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.030
what kind of person your father was?

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.920
He was blinded by money.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.350
He'd do anything for cash.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.310
One million.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.590
Impressive.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.220
Rushing forward
without caring for his life.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.470
What a hero!

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.420
Duozai.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.470
I understand your pain.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.800
You don't have to believe me.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.440
But our fate is predetermined.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.070
Drug dealers are cursed from birth.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.430
From the moment we were born,

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.030
we were labeled.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.820
A label we can never shake off.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.580
This is our destiny.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.100
We can't blame anyone,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.120
nor can we rely on anyone.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.500
The only one you can trust is yourself.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.250
Get lost.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.120
Get lost.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.990
If you have nowhere to go,

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.750
you can work with me.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.370
Be careful, Miss Tang.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.830
Let's leave here first.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.480
Let's go.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.200
Thank you for your hard work, Captain Luo.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.570
Hello, Mr. Zhen.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.030
The test results are out.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.760
They match Yipeng's analysis.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.590
Apart from a small portion being meth,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.790
the rest is just a mixture of rock sugar.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.930
What's the situation with Tang Du?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.830
We brought him
to the station for questioning.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.350
You couldn't get anything out of him.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.580
He refused to talk.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.530
Yes,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.050
he figured it out again.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.840
Tang Du claimed he knew nothing,

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.030
and said the person who called Liu Libo

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.560
is actually named Hong Kun.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.050
But he admited

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.920
he was in contact with Liu Libo.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.200
However, he denied

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.790
ordering Liu Libo to transport drugs.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.910
Based on all our evidence,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.850
the truth appears to be

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.550
that Tang Du,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.200
through Liu Libo as a middleman,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.680
used Gu Zhifeng's connections

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.110
to bring in the drugs.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.800
This was just a smokescreen.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.270
The real purpose

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.310
was to conduct a transaction at sea.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.190
But that shipment at sea

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.800
wasn't high-purity drugs.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.840
Exactly.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.180
That's the strange part.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.680
Going to all that trouble

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.410
over fake drugs makes no sense.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.550
I think Tang Du

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.020
had no idea that shipment

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.880
was actually compromised.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.440
Why?

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.200
When I boarded the boat,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.680
they

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.480
were desperately dumping
the stuff into the sea.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.400
Peng Jiangyu

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.940
fought desperately

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.590
and was eventually shot dead.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.680
They didn't seem to know

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.140
there was anything wrong
with the shipment.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.020
The drug cook

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.710
deceived Tang Du.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.340
That must be it.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.660
His previous shipment

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.350
was destroyed at Qipan Mountain.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.200
And the beach drug lab

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.220
was also raided.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.240
So in such a short time,

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.280
where could they find so much stuff?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.909
So they had to take a risk

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.199
and trade fake stuff with Tang Du.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.190
Right.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.060
But that would be incredibly bold.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.949
Tang Du runs Xin Sheng He.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.400
Isn't he afraid of retaliation?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.260
He's not afraid

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.880
because he knew

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.590
the shipment

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.520
would never reach Tang Du's hands.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.940
Here's the case.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.590
The coast guards

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.850
just sent me a message.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.600
Someone reported

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.520
a drug deal happening at sea.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.800
They even described

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.260
exactly which boat it was.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.960
So think about it,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.469
who could have

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.280
made that report?

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.639
The drug cook.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.770
Luo Yuansu.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.460
This Luo Yuansu

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.130
is really calculating.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.960
First, he used Tang Du and Liu Libo

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.179
to distract us.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:54.880
Then

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.840
he played the thief crying "stop thief,"

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840
reporting to the police himself

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.030
and buying time to escape.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.330
That was clever.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.770
But why would he go to all this trouble?

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.450
Is it possible

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.880
that it was for Mou Lang?

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.440
When we were tracking Liu Libo,

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.070
I discovered that Liu Libo
had taken Mou Lang

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.550
to Xinji as a hostage.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.410
It's very likely

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.240
that Luo Yuansu's deal with Tang Du

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.520
was all about Mou Lang.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.150
As Mou Haidong's illegitimate son,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.150
he doesn't even qualify
to enter the family shrine.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.730
So why would he risk so much

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.110
for Mou Lang?

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.210
There must be
huge financial interests behind this.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.880
So Mou Lang

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.580
is

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.320
the key to these huge financial interests.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.210
These drug dealers

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.800
are all cunning as foxes.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.210
You're overwhelmed?

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.590
Yes,

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.150
I'm overwhelmed.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.970
I didn't accomplish anything.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.230
But this time, Yipeng

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.130
should be credited for his work.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.480
Yeah.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.630
He didn't catch Luo Yuansu,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.410
but

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.650
he did seize a shipment of fake drugs.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.020
Thank you, Captain Luo.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:00.800
Thank you.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.860
Alright, alright,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.610
you two start arguing every time you meet.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.990
He talks like a child.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.670
Couldn't you elders
give the youngsters a break?

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:08.920
That's right, old man.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.960
Fine, I'm sorry.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.070
This time,

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.950
we didn't catch Luo Yuansu

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.040
or get evidence against Tang Du,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.440
but

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.790
Gu Zhifeng

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.270
and Liu Libo

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.670
have both been captured.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.930
As the old saying goes,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.070
the mantis stalks the cicada,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.590
unaware of the oriole behind.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.370
We can exploit their conflicts

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.440
and take them down one by one.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.640
But Captain Luo,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.680
you really do look old.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.400
When we're together,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.060
I feel like calling you uncle.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.200
Boss.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.150
Stop fooling around.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.880
What's with this "Boss" stuff?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.060
Let me know when you've made up your mind.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.970
I've already lost so much.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.620
We're even now.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.570
I don't want to see you again.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.220
This guy is very stubborn.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.450
He won't betray us, will he?

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.320
He can't clear his name anymore.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.400
Let's go.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.510
The yachts at this temple fair

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.960
are the tools used by drug dealers
for transportation at sea.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960
So I think those yacht owners

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.840
might be involved as well.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840
We need to investigate them.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840
Then I'll check on the yacht owners.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.230
Okay.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.140
And then,

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.800
about the driver who helped Liu Libo
transport drugs,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.860
how is he doing now?

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.390
He hasn't passed the critical period yet.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.590
But his identity has been confirmed.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.350
It's Ma Yong.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.500
Ma Yong?

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.800
Is it the same Ma Yong we arrested before?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.190
Yes.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.120
How did he get involved in this too?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.070
Ma Yong...

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.920
So now we can basically confirm

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.250
that the person
behind Liu Libo is Tang Du.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.760
And the person behind Ma Yong

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.020
is very likely
that drug cook Luo Yuansu.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.710
Well,

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.750
check Ma Yong's phone number

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.730
to see who he contacts frequently.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.030
I'll look into it.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.860
Duozai.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.400
You're finally back.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.110
I thought I wouldn't make it back either.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.390
Duozai.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.360
I don't know why

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.940
things turned out this way.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.680
We were afraid
you'd turn yourself in.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.250
So we put on an act and deceived you.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.280
They told us

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.320
we could get a million if it worked out.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.670
I trusted you so much!

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.540
But you

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.860
tricked me into being a mule.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:32.950
A mule!

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.750
I'm sorry.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.590
It's all our fault.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.630
After you left, we deeply regretted it.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.300
Duozai.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.000
We couldn't even eat.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.930
Uncle Ma asked me to give you this.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.520
What for?

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.150
If I had died,
what would I have needed money for?

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.920
Duozai,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.400
it wasn't like that.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400
Both of us thought

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.330
you couldn't come back from Xinji.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.030
Uncle Ma volunteered to make the delivery.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.400
He said after this job was done,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.790
we could bring you back.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.360
We thought we could
take the money and leave,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.420
never having to live like this again.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.710
It really wasn't like that.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.030
I don't know what to do.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.340
I really don't know.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.590
I really don't know what to do.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:25.400
Duozai, hit me.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.110
Hit me.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.000
Hit me, hit me!

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.200
Which hospital is he in?

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.730
What?

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.810
Which hospital is he in?

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.290
I need to claim his body!

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.230
I'll check right now.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.730
Captain Luo.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.510
This is Ma Yong's phone.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.170
It contains his call records.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.090
[All]

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.400
The person he contacted most is this

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:00.920
"Zai".

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.450
It's Ma Yong's son,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.110
whose full name is Ma Duozai.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.150
His son.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.550
Ma Duo...

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.370
Isn't Ma Duozai the one

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.870
involved in the case

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.240
with Gold-Tooth Wan?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.760
We've been looking for him

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.940
and Mou Jiahao,

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.500
but haven't found them yet.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.870
If Ma Yong is connected to Luo Yuansu,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.360
then Ma Duozai as his son

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.020
must know something about it.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.920
Ma Yong is in the hospital now.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.800
Can we use this situation

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.000
to draw out Ma Duozai?

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.400
It's possible.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.810
We can try.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.930
Then you make the call.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.760
Hello, are you a family member of Ma Yong?

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.190
Who's calling?

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:15.760
Mr. Ma Yong

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.960
is currently undergoing
emergency treatment at the No.2 Hospital.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.550
He hasn't passed the critical period yet.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.010
We hope his family can come
to the hospital as soon as possible.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:27.550
What happened to him?

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.670
Something's wrong?

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.240
Yes,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.460
but the situation doesn't look good.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.600
I'm out of town and can't make it.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.350
The patient's condition is very serious.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.010
We hope you can return quickly

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.480
to see him one last time.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:41.600
There's no need.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.640
Isn't he your father?

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.290
What kind of father is he?

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.660
He never fulfilled
his responsibilities as a father.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.510
Please just handle it yourselves,

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.110
thank you.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.800
You...

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.480
Call again.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.370
It's turned off.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.630
That's too heartless.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.220
Not even seeing his father one last time?

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.100
Are you crazy, Duozai?

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.930
Didn't you hear? Uncle Ma is still alive.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.190
Don't you want to see him one last time?

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.390
That must have been the police just now.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.190
How could the hospital
possibly take his phone

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.290
to call me?

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.450
What should we do now?

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.530
I need to see him.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.750
No matter what, I have to see him.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.760
I'll help you.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.640
Uncle Yang said

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:45.360
Ma Yong is a good-for-nothing

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.400
who's always in debt and selling stuff.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.070
Duozai has wanted
to leave him for a long time.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:50.460
But that's his father

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.880
who raised him.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.180
These thugs have no feelings left.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.670
Alright, stop gossiping.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.940
It doesn't help with the case.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:43:59.760
Let's check

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.420
Ma Duozai's

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.110
location first.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.480
Maybe not being in Nanzhou
is just an excuse.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.380
I'll go check.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.550
