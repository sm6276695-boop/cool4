Step aside.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.680
City Lord is here!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.400
City Lord!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.160
City Lord is here!

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.920
City Lord, don't open the gates!

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.720
Quiet!

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.560
City Lord, don't open the gates!

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.760
Our livelihood in Jin City
is precarious.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.480
How can we provide relief to refugees?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.280
Exactly.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.320
What if they bring diseases
into the city,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.600
then what to do?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.200
Exactly, City Lord.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.240
Everyone, I understand your concerns.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.680
Jin City faces threats both in and out.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.160
I don't want any more complications.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.000
But those refugees outside

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.280
are living people.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480
Imagine,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.480
if those refugees

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.360
were your own family members,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.520
your siblings,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800
your spouses, or your children,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.760
would you want to see them displaced

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.560
starving outside the city?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.600
They're not citizens of Jin City,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.320
but still of Central Plains.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.080
You are right, City Lord,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320
But what about our livelihood?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.640
Exactly.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.960
Consider our livelihood too, City Lord.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.640
Everyone, I hereby vow to you.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.880
Refugees will be settled
in designated areas.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.080
They won't disrupt your lives.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.040
Moreover,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.080
I'll station heavy guards
at the granary.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.080
No food plunder will be allowed.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.640
Not a single person shall go hungry.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.160
Those who contribute provisions

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.200
will receive tax exemptions this season.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.920
- Good!
- Very good!

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.840
Everyone, you shall know

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.440
that Mobei is eyeing us,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.720
having conquered

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.880
multiple cities surrounding Jin City.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760
Now more than ever,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.040
we must stand united

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.920
to go against our enemy.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.200
I believe we will

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.800
eventually bring
lasting peace to borders.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.680
- Well said!
- Well said!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.720
Good!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.200
I believe that one day,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.000
people will interact

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.640
without suspicion or doubt.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.440
Cities will coexist

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.400
in peaceful harmony.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.880
In my lifetime,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.400
I will witness this day to come.

00:04:35.904 --> 00:04:36.674
Thank you.

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.976
Here.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.560
Thank you.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.320
What are you doing? Step back!

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.480
It's alright. They're just starving.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.120
Here, one for you. And you.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.040
Here.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.880
I know

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.240
you've been hungry for a long time

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.880
and want food quickly,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.120
but rest assured.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.560
Once Jin City opens its gates,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.080
we'll protect you

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.360
and won't abandon anyone.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.320
Please line up.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.920
Trust us.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.320
Everyone will get food.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.240
One by one.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.680
My lady, our provisions

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.360
may be insufficient for the refugees.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.080
I have some money.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.160
Send someone to fetch more.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.000
Miss Yu, no need.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.480
My family has ample grain reserves.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.960
I'll let someone send them over.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.480
Mr. Song.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.080
It's okay, Miss Yu.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.760
Helping you and City Lord
through this crisis

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760
is my greatest joy.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.040
Okay.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:37.716
(City Lord's Mansion)

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.920
Wei Feng, are the horses ready?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.600
Yes.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.160
Let's go.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.240
Yuanbao, what's wrong?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.280
Why are they in a hurry?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.440
They went to

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.680
deal with the granary issue.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.000
(Just as in my dream. The granary fell,)

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.240
(and they'll face
a Mobei ambush on the way.)

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.080
(I must catch up)

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.400
(to prevent the disaster.)

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.040
Hyah!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.600
Hyah!

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.120
Wei Feng, how much longer?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.960
Almost there,
just after passing through this.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.520
Hyah!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.080
Liu Bingmo, faster!

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.360
Let's take the shortcut.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.440
Yes, my lady.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.200
Hyah!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.840
(Yunqing, you must be safe.)

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.480
Faster!

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.880
Liu Bingmo, what's wrong?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.720
My lady, the carriage
seems to be broken.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.720
Why?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.800
I don't know.
It suddenly stopped moving.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.160
Far from the main road?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.840
Not far.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.280
Just after the village ahead.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.040
My lady.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480
I'll go first.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.640
Catch up to me later.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.520
Where's the village?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.000
Anyone?

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.280
Anyone?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.400
My lady.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.160
Madam.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.280
Madam.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.160
Madam.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.920
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.560
Wan.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.760
Madam.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.440
Where are you?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.200
Madam.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.240
Madam.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.559
Madam.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.280
Wan! Wan!

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.080
Wan! Wan!

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.280
Wan! Wan!

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.160
Wan!

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.480
(You can't even protect
the woman you love.)

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.360
(Mu Yunqing, you're such a loser.)

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.360
City Lord.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.280
Why was she there today?

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.600
She learned you were
heading to the granaries,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440
had to catch up to you,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.320
and said you'd encounter danger.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.160
Why she knows it?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120
Are you okay?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.240
I tried to escape last night
to give you the token,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.520
but I was caught.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.480
(So she knew Eunuch Duan would come.)

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.400
The token is gone.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.840
Why didn't he give you trouble?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.920
I thought I'd lost you again.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.240
(So she's also had)

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.280
(prophetic dreams like me.)

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.520
(Wan.)

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.320
(Why didn't you tell me?)

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.240
Wan.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.000
Why were you there today?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.640
Did you foresee something?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.800
Yunqing, actually,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.040
I had a long dream before.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.960
Most of it comes true in reality.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.680
Like today's danger
you'd face on the road

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.360
and Wei Feng's tragic death.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.600
I just wanted to prevent all this.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:48.360
Wan, how did we die in your dream?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.880
In my dream...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.720
When I realized I could use

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.640
the dream contents as clues,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.480
I wanted us to keep alive.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.160
Yunqing, I'm sorry.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.840
But I never imagined all this

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.040
would make us lose our child.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.720
Yunqing, I'm sorry.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.560
Wan, don't be sorry.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.720
It's me...

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.880
Just let me be alone, okay?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.360
I need some time.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.000
Give me some time
