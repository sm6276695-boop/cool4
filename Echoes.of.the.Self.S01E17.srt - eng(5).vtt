[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.330
Linglan

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430
is my trusted henchman

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.730
stationed in Daqing.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.230
So,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.960
from the very beginning,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.120
I knew your identity.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.930
Now that you know my identity,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520
why didn't you expose me?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.000
The reason is simple.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.060
I initially thought you could be useful.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.400
But I never expected

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.800
you would be so stubborn.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800
You were constantly at odds with me.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.630
I'm very curious about one thing.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.100
Why do you look

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.670
so much like Xi?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.120
What exactly are you going to do?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.720
That's none of your concern.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.860
Right now,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.690
you only have two options.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.570
First,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.070
marry Prince Yan

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.080
to become his princess consort

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.340
and cooperate with me.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140
As for the second option,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.210
you will die in this mansion

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.720
as Miss Zhou Ruoxi.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.920
You did loan sharking to hoard wealth,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.660
recruited soldiers in the black market,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.530
took the Military Supply Route permit

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.460
and carried on illicit affairs.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.200
You're planning a rebellion, right?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.890
Though you've figured it out,
what can you do?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.180
Madam Cui, the mastermind behind
the loan-sharking case,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.400
has already been executed.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.640
Stockpiling weapons

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.500
and plotting rebellion

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.100
are just rumors.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.510
I'd like to advise you'

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.850
to consider your current situation.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.380
If

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.300
you don't cooperate with me,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.460
do you think

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.370
you can leave here alive?

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.500
What an evil Minister of Rites!

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.550
What a crazy person you are, Lord Zhou!

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.180
Go to hell!

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.120
Let's go!

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.170
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.030
Your Highness!

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.010
Your Highness!

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.570
How did she get injured like this?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.970
It was Zhou Kui.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.580
He's working for Daqing.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.820
Just now,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.720
I found

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.250
the Military Supply Route permit
in his room.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.260
I suspect he wants to transport weapons

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.590
into the Imperial City.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.190
Liang Feng,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.320
raid Zhou's Mansion!

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.640
Yes.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.480
Wait.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.860
He has already known my identity.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.520
He'll definitely destroy the evidence.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.930
The raid would be meaningless.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.890
Alright.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.960
Have a rest first.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.810
We'll discuss

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.010
those matters later.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.760
Your Highness.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.850
Put me down.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.579
It's not good if others see us.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.360
Others?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.970
There's no one here.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.720
Liang Feng.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Do you see anyone?

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.800
No. No.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
There's nobody.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.730
I'll find a doctor.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.910
Luckily, after the doctor checked on you,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.040
he said you are not seriously injured.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.070
You're awake.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.250
Where else does it hurt?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.940
I need to stay alive

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.560
to marry you.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.850
I'll be fine.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.490
Let me help you up.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.470
Now that you've already noticed

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.730
the danger yesterday,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.260
why did you still put yourself at risk

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.990
without telling me in advance?

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.659
Yesterday,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.700
in the palace,
I saw Linglan with a secret letter.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.680
I wasn't sure about
the content of the letter,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.040
and I didn't know

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.590
who Linglan is working for.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.480
So, I wanted to find evidence
as soon as possible.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.560
Find evidence?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.480
I won't do this again.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.970
You...

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680
Earlier,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.000
I found a secret letter

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460
from the Crown Prince to Zhou Kui
in his room.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.920
The letter instructed

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.240
Zhou Kui

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.940
to find the missing spies.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.600
As for the matter of those spies,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.460
I've known about it for some time.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.010
When the Princess of Daqing
came for the royal marriage,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.880
Shu learned that

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.960
spies from Daqing had infiltrated
the Imperial City.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.560
So he specifically sent a team
to investigate.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.360
But for some reason,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.880
those spies

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.130
have gone missing.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.930
And the tokens they carried

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.020
have coincidentally appeared
in the black market.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.870
All the clues we have now

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.080
point to the Eastern Palace.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.670
Crown Prince Shu and Zhou Kui

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.480
might have been in collusion
for a long time.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.680
As you said,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.340
the evidence is solid.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.840
However,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.360
if you think about this carefully,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.690
you'll find
it doesn't benefit Shu at all.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.330
Since we have different opinions,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.540
why don't we

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.440
ask Crown Prince Shu
to clarify this matter?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.450
Then I'll go to
the Crown Prince's Mansion

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.680
and ask Shu to come discuss this.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.240
Wait.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.110
Zhou Kui has already known my identity.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.080
And we don't know the situation

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.810
in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.290
Besides,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.040
because of the matter of
the Princess of Daqing before,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.640
you and the Crown Prince
have had a falling out.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.150
I'm afraid he won't come.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.180
It's not entirely impossible.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.020
Your Highness.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.250
Someone just delivered a message.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.270
If you learn the whereabouts of
the Princess of Daqing,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.070
go to the forest outside the city

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.420
at 9 o'clock tonight.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.260
The Princess of Daqing?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.730
Isn't she with Yan?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.950
Hya!

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.090
Whoa!

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.050
Who's there?

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.030
Your Highness?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.520
Your Highness?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120
Where has His Highness gone?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.880
His Highness is missing!

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.600
Split up and search!

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.080
Yes!

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.560
Yes!

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.800
Yes!

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.330
Let's go!

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.840
This way!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.820
Your Highness!

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.400
How dare you!

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.430
Do you know who I am?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.320
How dare you tie me up?

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.409
Untie me!

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.760
Untie me!

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.060
Let me go!

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.250
Hurry up!

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.920
You little brat!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.700
You're still laughing?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.790
How dare you tie me up?

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.210
Untie me now!

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480
Untie me!

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.760
Shu.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.400
Well,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.390
promise me first that

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.320
after I untie you,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.640
you should talk with me in peace.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.910
Hurry up!

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.190
Hurry up!

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.850
You little brat!

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.690
Come here!

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.750
Come here!

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.120
Hurry up!

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.060
You little brat!

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.470
I'll execute your entire clan!

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.590
Your Highness,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.760
you are also a member of

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.960
his clan.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.280
Zhou Ruoxi?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.309
It's really you.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.530
You've bewitched Yan

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.800
and made him commit

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.240
such a disrespectful act!

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.570
What are you going to do?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.700
You are planning a rebellion,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.220
huh?

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.210
You're stupid!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.850
How dare she insult me?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.640
So what?

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.910
Even if you inherit the throne,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.700
you

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.690
will only let sycophants rule.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.490
You're just a terrible ruler

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.020
who will be easily deceived
and manipulated!

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.670
She's slandering me!

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.000
How dare you slander me!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.800
Shu.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.320
You're stopping me, huh?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.640
Shu.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.560
Why are you just standing there?

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.280
Shu.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.570
Are you letting her continue to
speak such filth?

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.940
You are a fool!

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.070
Why are you insulting him?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.930
If you've got the guts, come at me!

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.000
Let me go!

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.560
-Let me go!
-Shu!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.120
Let me go!

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.880
Shu!

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.590
I brought you here today

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.420
because we truly have important matters
to discuss.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.420
The Eastern Palace is full of spies.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.000
Your Highness.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.650
Your Highness.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.920
We just wanted you to slip away unnoticed

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.180
and avoid prying eyes.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.730
We wanted to find a safe place
to discuss important issues.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.280
Even though there are important matters,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.340
you shouldn't have been so reckless.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.340
We've already known that

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.050
behind the loan-sharking case,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.840
someone is seeking personal gain

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.720
to forge weapons

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.410
with the intention of rebellion.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.900
Your Highness, who do you think

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.320
is behind this case

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.810
and what is their purpose?

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.020
Why is this in your hand?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.810
Your Highness, you don't need
to ask too much.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.940
You only need to know

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.200
that this token was last seen

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.350
in the black market.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.750
It was used to trade weapons
and arms and ordnance.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.000
You mean

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.890
someone wants to place the blame

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.790
on me, right?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.260
Who is this person?

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.600
This pattern

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.140
was traced from Zhou Kui's jade pendant.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.430
According to the Princess of Daqing,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.350
this belongs to the Daqing royal family.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.590
Zhou Kui is a henchman of
the Daqing royal family?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.920
He wants to use me

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.830
to commit treason.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.780
I found

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.770
the Military Supply Route permit
in Zhou Kui's study.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.770
We suspect

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.140
he wants to use the Military Supply Route

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.670
to transport weapons
into the Imperial City.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.800
Zhou Kui is cunning.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.520
I'll go arrest him right now.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.320
Wait.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.450
To catch a thief, we need evidence.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.610
All of this is just our speculation.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.040
I urge Your Highness

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.190
not to act rashly,

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.970
lest we alert our target.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.160
How do you want me

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.360
to cooperate with you two?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.160
Set a trap for him.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.980
Let him expose his own weakness.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.530
You're not Zhou Ruoxi, are you?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.160
You've finally vented your revenge.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.280
I was really

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.400
worried.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.320
I was afraid your loose talk

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320
would offend Shu.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.540
Then,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.820
you may get in trouble.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.730
Then why didn't you stop me?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.760
You just let me

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.920
speak freely

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.540
and insult the Crown Prince.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.110
I love seeing you

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.800
speak freely

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.720
and settle scores so boldly.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.840
Fu Wei.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.160
When frustrations are bottled
up for too long,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.290
vent your pent-up feelings

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.270
is the only way

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.630
to relieve yourself.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.720
Aren't you worried that I might
take your brother's life?

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.530
You won't.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.230
Because you know

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.610
Shu

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.560
is merely being deceived and used.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.380
He's certainly not the real culprit.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.310
And the person you want to deal with

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.200
isn't him.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.150
Even though His Highness has agreed to
cooperate with us now,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.910
we still

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.770
haven't found

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.620
any evidence of Zhou Kui's loan sharking

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.220
and stockpiling weapons
in the Imperial City.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.850
We don't know his next move either.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.120
We're exposed

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.410
while he operates in the shadows.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.980
I'm worried...

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.130
I'm here with you.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.180
No matter what will happen,

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.930
I will always be with you.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.430
May I find someone
who loves me wholeheartedly

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.890
and stays with me forever.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200
Yan.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.160
You're truly braver

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.990
and more fortunate than me,'

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.840
Your Highness!

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.790
Something terrible has happened!

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.190
His Highness is missing!

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.390
Missing?

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.580
What do you mean?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.060
Well,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.450
I don't know how it happened.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.920
After he left the city,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.550
he vanished without a trace.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.360
Perhaps we should report this to Lord Zhou

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.290
to prepare for all contingencies.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.140
No need.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.940
His Highness's disappearance

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.340
concerns the stability of Yunrui's court.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.840
It must not be leaked.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.940
His Highness's disappearance
is very suspicious.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.290
If he were captured by
Prince Yan's men,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.030
the consequences would be terrible.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.110
Perhaps we should inform Lord Zhou,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.190
in case later on...

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.660
I said it's not necessary.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.740
I am your master.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.560
Whose orders should you follow?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.420
Please calm down, Your Highness.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.140
Forget it.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.040
Send all our people out

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.220
to secretly search
for His Highness's whereabouts.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.260
Remember,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.730
keep this quiet.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.600
Yes, Your Highness.
