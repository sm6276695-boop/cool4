WEBVTT

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
And this is "ETERNAL Kizuna."

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560
Congratulations.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.440
The game we poured our hearts into

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.240
has succeeded

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.800
beyond our expectations.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.960
I’ll create a character based on me,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.360
named Haruki.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.160
Headquarters in Japan

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
asked me to return for their big project.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.280
Phat.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.200
Not a day went by without thoughts of you.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.080
Now I know

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.800
how important you are to me.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.080
Junji.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.120
You okay, Junji?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.640
Hey…

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.840
We talked about this.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.520
When it's time to part ways,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.040
we wouldn’t cry.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.400
At first…

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.240
I thought I could do it.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.280
But…

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680
Now that it's happening,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.480
I can't.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.440
I'm not as strong as you are.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.120
Don't be like that.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.800
Don't cry, Jun-chan.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.640
I promise

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.560
I'll fly over

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.640
to Japan whenever I'm free.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.360
Okay?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.920
Thanks, Jeans.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.360
And…

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.040
Don't worry about Hill, Boss.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.720
He's in good hands.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.080
Not a single scratch on him.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.200
I'll take him out every night

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.600
so he won't ever feel lonely.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.640
Ouch!

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.360
I was joking. I wouldn't dare.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.560
I think

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.840
you're not crying

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.640
because you'll be far from Hill.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.720
But because

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.120
you can't eat the green
curry at my place anymore.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.880
Am I right?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.920
Really?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.360
Is that so?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.840
Maybe.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.480
Anyway,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.880
Safe travels, Boss.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.080
Thanks.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.960
Don't cry.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.680
I'm not.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.600
No more tears.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.080
Don't cry.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.520
- I'm not crying.
- Right.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.440
Let's go.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.960
Bye-bye.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.560
I'll help.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.120
I hope your project goes well.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.040
I'll always be cheering you on.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400
Just like how Yuka

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000
always supported me with her smile.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.120
Ganbatte ne!

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.920
Take care of yourself

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360
while I’m gone.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.240
Drink lots of water

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.440
when you eat those pork skewers.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.880
Got it.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.440
And you too.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320
Take care of yourself.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.800
Get plenty of rest.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.520
And…

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.880
While I'm here,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.400
I will…

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.000
make sure I finish Haruki on time.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.600
make sure I finish Haruki on time.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
Promise me

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.640
we’ll say goodbye

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.880
together on Yuka’s last day.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.640
I promise.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.800
Junji.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.120
Junji.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.800
Hill.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.480
Junji.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.960
(Three months later)

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.640
Ohayo (Good morning), Hill.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.040
Ohayo, Junji.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.560
You can go back to sleep.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.160
It’s still early in Thailand.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.480
You also went to bed late last night.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.400
No way.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.320
How could I?

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.920
You're not here with me, Junji.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.040
Alright, fine.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.480
Go take a shower.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.600
Stop talking.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.400
Right, go shower.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.960
Hill.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.800
Hill!

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.040
What are you doing?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.440
Undress in the bathroom!

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.960
They'll see everything.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.720
Ta-da!

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.880
Want some?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.200
Man…

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.640
You're making me want to
go back and have some.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.920
If you come back today,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.800
I'll buy you a hundred sticks.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.240
Here.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.000
Open wide.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.760
Get some rest, Hill.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.640
You could faint.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.240
But work's not done.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.000
I want to finish it first.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.600
I’m so tired, Junji.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.920
Give me some encouragement.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.280
No, work until you drop.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.600
So stubborn.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.080
Just a bit, please?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.120
Junji.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.320
It's so late. You're not afraid of ghosts?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.280
Boo!

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.040
Ghosts?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.440
Save that for the kids.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.680
I just don't want you to stay up late.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.840
You always work so hard.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.000
It's been tough lately

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.320
It's been tough lately

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.600
because we just started.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.560
But I already got a team to help.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.480
Soon, it’ll be more manageable.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.720
[sighs]

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.760
I miss green curry and pork skewers a lot.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.280
So,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.920
you only miss the food?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.600
Not anything else?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.200
Besides food,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.400
I miss…

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.000
Oh!

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.560
Tourist spots.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.960
I still have many places in Thailand to visit.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.280
Chiang Mai is pretty.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.760
Phuket is also great

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.200
for scuba diving.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.000
The Full Moon Party in Phang Nga.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400
But,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.280
what I miss the most is…

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.680
Hey.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.400
You fell asleep?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.240
You must be

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.720
exhausted as well.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.000
I just want you

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.280
to take care of yourself.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.360
Especially when I’m so far away.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.000
I…

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.280
I miss you, Hill.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.400
I…

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.240
I really miss you.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.080
(Babe, what do you want for lunch?)

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.160
(Something hot. How about mala skewers?)

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.480
(Mala may be hot, but not
as hot as me. Tee-hee!)

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.840
Geez.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.760
You’re only a few steps apart and

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.960
you're still texting each other?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.720
Alright, everyone.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720
Gather around.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.000
Hello, everyone.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.280
Hello, everyone.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.520
- Hello, Boss.
- Hi, Boss.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.240
Are you well, Ms. Secretary?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.120
How's the new boss?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.080
Boss Pao is way stricter than you.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.920
[laughs]

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.560
Come on, Boss.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.840
It's only temporary.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.800
Soon, they'll send someone to replace me.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.680
That'll take a while.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.320
They won't find someone that quickly.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.320
And you seem like a good fit for the role.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.320
You mean it?

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.800
Don't flatter me.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.520
Anyway,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.680
I'll boot up the PC for your remote access.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.280
I've shared the livestream
schedule prep with the fans,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.200
through PRISMSTAR TH Channel Online,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.040
as you've requested.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040
Under the topic of

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.320
online game development in Japan.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.760
Thank you, everyone.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.560
Alright.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.600
Back to work.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.080
Go on.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.760
I saw that, dear.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.400
Aren't you going back to work?

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.600
I'm just looking ahead, to where…

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.280
our company's future is.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.800
I'm not at the office.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.680
I'm at Phat's place.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.960
What's up, Hill?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.560
I haven't seen you in days, bro.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.600
Thought you'd quit and become a chef.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.160
You little…

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.040
Now you're teasing me.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.760
I'm here because of

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.880
the new project.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.640
It's a restaurant simulation game.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.680
So, I have to do my research here.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.640
And how's that coming along?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.920
Still in the research stage.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.920
That's dope.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.800
Is it the data you sent me?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.160
All those restaurant ingredients looked amazing.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.960
I think you should add

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.200
150 more vegetables.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.960
Dylon works at a Japanese restaurant.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.160
Stop messing around, dude.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.160
Ugh.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.960
Ready?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.760
Hang on, let me get the gloves.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.080
These are such a pain.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.680
Ah…

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.080
Here.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.400
Pull.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.360
Okay, all set.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.080
Before we make sashimi,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.560
we need to slice the fish first.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.120
Ready, Chef Bay?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.320
Ready, Chef Phat.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.120
Mwah, mwah.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.720
Quit fooling around.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.360
Focus.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.240
Here, start slicing.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.920
How?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.600
I literally just showed you.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.240
Right.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.560
More diagonally.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.760
- That's good.
- Like this?

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.040
Too thick.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.360
What? Still too thick?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.400
Seriously.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.360
Okay.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.400
Good.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.160
Ow!

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.720
Did you cut yourself?

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.240
Maybe.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.720
Ouch!

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.480
Stop messing about.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.920
Come on.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.720
Focus.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.400
A little encouragement?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.200
Just hurry up.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.320
I got it. I'm done!

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.000
See?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.280
See?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.120
There.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.800
It's finished. Where's my praise?

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.080
Good.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.400
Do I get a reward?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.600
What reward?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.280
But we're packed today.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.360
It's fine, we just need to adjust a bit.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.640
Quick.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.440
That's it.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.800
The camera's rolling, you know?

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.960
Careful.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.000
You’ll knock over the glasses.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.400
Oh, man.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.040
Ta-da!

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.240
Perfectly done.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.840
Well? Check it out.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.520
How is this perfect?

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.160
It’s wrong.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.200
But I did as you said.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.160
I copied yours.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.880
No, that's not right.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.840
Sitting here,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.480
the placement

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.960
is in this order, right?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.120
For this side…

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.960
you have to arrange in the same order.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.080
Spoon's of the left.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.480
But you put it on the right.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.320
They're a lefty.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320
No.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.840
See?

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.040
You talk back every single time.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.440
Sorry.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.680
But,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.040
there's no need to shout.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.840
You're the reason I had to.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.160
Come on.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:09.800
Hurry up.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.320
Switch them.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.120
Softer, will you?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.920
That’s not right.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.000
The knife should go on the inside.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.720
Ugh.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.800
Why so difficult?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.680
It’s all cutlery.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.360
Make sure the wine glass
is at an angle.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.120
That'll make it easier to grab it.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.800
- That'll make it easier to grab it.
- Wait.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.760
Forty five degrees?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.520
Yes, here.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520
You tricked me again.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.560
Do it yourself.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.560
Ugh.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.000
- Like this? Good?
- Yeah.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.680
That's right.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.040
- Finally.
- Good.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.760
What’s next?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.640
Where’s the napkin?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.680
Huh?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680
I told you already.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.400
Where is it?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.160
I don't know. How could I know?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.640
I sent you a list of things to prepare.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.000
- But it’s your place.
- Go.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.800
Doesn't matter.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.000
Which hair color

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Which hair color

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.720
would suit Haruki?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.280
I'd say gray.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.360
Or silver.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.080
It's a nice contrast to Yuka's pink hair.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.440
Okay, let's see.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.080
Let's go.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.160
[background chatter] Gray, like this.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.920
[background chatter] Yeah.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.160
[background chatter] Looks good.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.920
And this outfit.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.000
[background chatter] Try white.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.640
[background chatter] Too pale.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.280
I have an update to share with you all.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.000
[background chatter]

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.720
I think blue might be better.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.080
- We can try.
- Yeah, try it.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.520
That'll match the outfit.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.880
Also Yuka's pink hair and outfit…

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.240
Can we change the mountain to the sea?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:37.880
Sure.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.720
Yeah, and…

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.360
I have an announcement

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.320
about bonuses.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.960
Now, now.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.880
Cat got you all's tongues now?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.480
Come on.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.840
So, what about the bonus?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.960
I'm excited.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.120
About the bonus I just mentioned,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.240
there is…

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.280
Well,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.440
There's no update yet.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.280
- The show's over.
- Real smooth, man.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.720
- What's his problem?
- Slick.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.560
I'm not done.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.760
Because this is

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.880
extremely important.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.760
I believe many of you already noticed.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.040
Within our game,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.600
many players

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.240
have maxed out their levels.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.680
In other words,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.120
our game has hit a wall.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.520
So the company wants to make a "Bonus Stage".

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.640
And the Game Designer who will

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.280
plan

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.240
and present it

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.680
is none other than…

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.080
None other than

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.920
the one who created Mike.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.040
That's you, Hill.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.200
[cheers and applause]

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.480
Congratulations, Hill.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.280
[cheers and applause]

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.520
He's the perfect fit for this.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.400
Good luck!

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:46.920
Thanks.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.760
You’re the chosen one.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.960
And you'll be presenting

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.400
at the headquarters in Tokyo.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.280
What?!

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:53.800
Yup.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.760
In Japan?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.720
- Correct.
- Yeah.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.960
And you only have this week to prepare.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.200
Your flight's next week.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.360
Wait a minute.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.280
We're shutting down

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.600
Yuka's game this week, right?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.520
Haruki's design isn't done yet.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.440
Headquarters in Tokyo

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.640
wants you to take on this role.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.280
Yep.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.840
As for your schedule,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.880
that's your problem.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.720
Right.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.440
You might have to say
goodbye to Yuka in Japan.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.040
Now you must be worried

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.760
about how to prepare for it,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.320
right?

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.840
You'll get helpers.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.320
We'll assign you three coaches

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.800
to train you before you go to Japan.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.360
Yeah!

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.600
And…

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.880
Who are the these coaches?

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:47.440
[laughs mischievously]

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.800
As your first coach,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.360
I'll help with the Bonus Stage.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.200
You will?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.040
Let's see.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.720
The players

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.000
must win over Mike's mom and sister?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.720
must win over Mike's mom and sister?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.320
Both of them have traumas with love

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.640
and are against Mike dating.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.960
Sounds good?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.640
Why does that sound so…

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.440
so cliché?

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.840
Cliché?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.840
Yeah.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.720
Damn, cliché?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.960
If that's too cliché,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.760
then…

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.080
What you just recited

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.160
were simple phrases

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.040
that'll help you get by in Japan.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.440
Alright, one more time.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:45.880
Got it.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.440
Where's the train station?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.880
Where's the train station?

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.840
I lost my wallet.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.920
I lost my wallet.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.240
I'm lost.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.680
I'm lost.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.520
Excellent.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.400
You memorized them so quickly.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.440
Well,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.840
I did some homework as well.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.720
Really?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.240
Then tell me what you know.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.320
So…

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.720
From what I can remember…

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.840
Me means eyes.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.400
Yes.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.080
Legs is Ashi.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.440
Mimi means ears.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.120
Buta means pig.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.160
Kani means crab.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.000
Inu means dog.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.960
Iku means to go.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.600
Kuru means to come.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.520
Ocha means tea.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.040
And Kohi means coffee.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.800
Teehee!

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.120
Very good.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560
Impressive.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.640
Nah, come on.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.280
I got it from TikTok.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.520
By the way,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.120
I have a favor to ask.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.040
What is it?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.440
Well…

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.840
I'd like you

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.720
to teach me a dish to win Junji's heart.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.000
I see.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.240
I see.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.680
That'd be green curry.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.360
You scared me for a bit there.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.120
I'll do it.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.760
Thank you.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.360
- It's boiling.
- Just a second.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.800
Done.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.760
Chillies.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.880
Okay.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.120
Next is meat.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.600
Yes.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.360
Add meat first, right?

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:22.800
Yes.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.520
Meat.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.920
Okay.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.200
Do you remember what to add next?

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.760
Eggplants?

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.080
I remember.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.080
Eggplants.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560
Wait up.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.440
You have to tear them first.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.200
- Tear them.
- Tear them?

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.680
- Yes.
- Tear them?

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.240
Otherwise it won't be fragrant.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240
- Like this?
- Yeah.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.120
Good.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.400
Okay.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.960
A bit smaller.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.880
Good.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.440
Hm…

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:28.920
Wow!

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.440
Not bad at all

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440
for your first try.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.120
Well, it's your recipe.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.200
It must be good.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.880
Careful.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.000
Is it cooked?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.280
- It's cooked.
- Nice.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.120
Careful, it’s hot.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.440
Nom, nom.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:43.920
Oh!

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.320
Hoh! (hot).

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.440
Damn.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.240
That's too many layers!

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.400
You're not going to a snow town.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.360
But.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.000
Isn't it cold in Japan?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.440
Isn't it cold in Japan?

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.400
I don't want freeze to death.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.680
You're there for the presentation.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.880
You need to stand out

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.680
to leave a lasting impression.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:13.760
Oh.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.040
That one will catch their eyes.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.160
But it lacks credibility.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:18.960
What?

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.880
This one will do.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.080
This is the one.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.720
It's perfect for you as a Game Designer.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.720
So handsome.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.080
Thank you, Ms. Jeans.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.920
Hill.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.800
Here, a gift for Boss.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.680
This will remind him of Thailand.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.200
Take it.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.480
The elephant pants?

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.000
What's wrong?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.480
This is Thailand's soft power, you know?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.160
Got it?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.680
Alright.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.400
Make sure you don't lose it, okay?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.680
- Thanks, Bay.
- Don't forget.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.360
Take this.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.040
It's the best.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.480
Best gift from Thailand.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.080
Durian.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.520
Hey!

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.120
Durian?

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.400
I can't bring it on the plane, Pao.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.720
I know that!

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.280
I'm not that dumb, dude.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.920
It's dried mango.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.440
A Premium grade one.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.640
Once he had some,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.880
he'll surely miss Thailand.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.400
I see.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.720
Alright, thank you.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200
When you meet Junji,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.120
use that irresistible recipe.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480
And safe travels.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.480
Got it.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.040
Thank you.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.240
Send my regards to Jun-chan.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.000
Is Jun-chan picking you up at the airport?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.200
Is Jun-chan picking you up at the airport?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.480
He's probably working.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.800
We haven't talked much.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.000
Oh.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.760
It’s almost time.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.280
Alright.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.160
Yeah, go on.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.680
- Thanks, everyone.
- Have a safe trip.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.240
- See you!
- Safe travels.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.600
- We'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, man.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.720
- Keep in touch.
- Bye!

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.280
- Will do!
- Go.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:22.960
Which counter?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.520
I'll go with you.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.320
Hello.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.760
May I see your passport?

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.000
Passport.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.800
How’s everything? All good?

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800
I’m fine, Junji.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.280
But where are you now?

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.200
At the office?

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.440
I'm outside the meeting room.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.720
You know, I'm more excited

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.240
to see you than anything.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.880
Hill.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.400
About today,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.600
I won't be at the meeting.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.040
Something came up.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.280
Really?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.400
That’s okay.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.160
Are we

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.480
going to say goodbye
to Yuka together tonight?

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760
Sorry.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.440
I have important work to do tonight.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.040
So, I can't say goodbye to Yuka with you.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.080
Junji.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.840
It's been four months.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.200
I thought I could finally

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.000
see you again on this trip.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.240
see you again on this trip.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.680
I'm sorry, Hill.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.240
It's really urgent.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.680
Well,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.880
this trip is also very short.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.000
Two days.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.400
And I'm going back tomorrow.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.200
So, we really couldn't meet up?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.200
Even if we can't meet today,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.360
we'll meet again another time.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.720
I miss you, Hill.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.440
Do you miss me?

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.640
Of course.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.360
I want you to be in a good mood

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.640
before the presentation.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.040
I promise I’ll see you

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.640
as soon as work’s done.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.040
Thanks, Junji.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.720
Mr. Hill, this way please.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.640
Yes.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.920
Now, I have some sample
scenes of our Bonus Stage.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.240
This is the last one.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.720
Your idea is brilliant.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.840
It’ll really help with promoting the game.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.160
Thank you for the kind compliment.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.000
I’ll keep working hard.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.600
I’ll keep working hard.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:13.720
[applause]

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.200
What?

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.440
Still not answering.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.760
I was so ready to brag.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.560
Junji must be busy.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.880
(I'm at the hotel.)

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.320
(Is everything okay? You seem busy.)

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.960
(Take care of yourself.)

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.800
(I'll go shower. Talk to you later.)

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.000
I'm sorry, Yuka.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.880
I really wanted to finish Haruki

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.600
so he could be with you.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.160
But I failed.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.120
It's alright.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.760
That's not important.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.960
Because what matters most to me

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.440
is you, Hill.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.440
I was created to take care
of you and support you.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.160
Thanks a lot, Yuka.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.480
All this time,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.760
you meant so much to me.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.800
I've grown mature

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.160
and come this far.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.520
It's partly

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.200
because you've encouraged me.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.400
I’m so proud of you, Hill.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.120
For completing such a difficult task today.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.560
Tomorrow and the days that follow,

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.640
I'll always be by your side.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.040
Ganbatte ne!

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.920
Thank you so much, Yuka.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.080
Goodbye.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.040
Goodbye, Hill.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.920
Ganbatte ne! Always.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.040
Feeling lonely?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.240
Let me be your friend.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.480
Ganbatte ne!

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.960
You can do it!

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.960
I'm waiting for the day you succeed.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.560
Ganbatte ne!

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.040
Rise and shine.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.160
It's time to wake up.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.000
Yeah!

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.320
Yeah!

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.800
Yuka.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.120
I completed the mission.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.920
Yuka!

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.240
It'll be fine, Hill.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.440
I know you can do it.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.040
Thanks, Yuka.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.200
I won’t let you disappear.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.920
(I'm heading to the airport now.)

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.600
I went all the way to Japan to see you.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.360
What the hell, Junji.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.560
What got you so busy?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.800
Look.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.000
These nice gifts.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.040
But you don’t get them, Junji.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.840
Serves you right.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120
[doorbell rings]

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240
[doorbell rings]

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:28.920
[doorbell rings]

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.440
I'm coming.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.920
Once is enough.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.680
[doorbell rings]

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.080
Junji.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.360
Did you miss me,

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:13.640
Hill?

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.800
Hold up.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.080
Why?

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.760
Don’t hug me.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.800
You broke your promise.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.080
You promised

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.320
to be with me on Yuka’s last day.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.120
But you didn’t.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.000
I went all the way to Japan.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.600
I went all the way to Japan.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.440
Even if we couldn’t meet up,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.200
we could've called.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.400
Or read my messages.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.880
I know you're sulking.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.800
I'm sorry.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.720
But…

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.920
Work was really tough.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.320
You must be really, really busy.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.680
It was urgent.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.800
Had to fly to Korea for
a big sponsorship deal.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.280
I was on the plane

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.240
when you called.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.480
After I'm done, I rushed to see you.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.360
So I did as I promised.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.200
Have you eaten?

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.600
I came straight to you.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.760
So…

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.360
I haven't eaten anything.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.760
You can have this.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.880
It's your gift.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:56.560
What?

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.080
Go shower first.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:41:59.640
Ugh.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.000
You just got back.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
You just got back.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.480
Go, go.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.960
Alright, mom.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.320
Together?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.920
Hey!

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.680
Fine, come on.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.880
Junji.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.920
How is it?

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.960
Tastes good?

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.920
Good.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.840
Tomorrow,

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.080
I'll take you out for some good food.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.960
How long are you staying for?

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.560
Three days.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.480
Only three days?

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.160
That's so short.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.600
Thought you'd be here longer.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.520
Just a brief visit, huh?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.920
It's alright.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.560
Better than not seeing you at all.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.800
The thing is,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.360
I've been counting days

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.480
until your project is over.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.560
So we can be together again.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.640
Junji.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.640
Are you okay?

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:28.840
Junji.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.200
If I

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.160
ever make you uncomfortable,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.240
just tell me.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.360
It’s better than

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.640
seeing you suffer like this.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.880
I…

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.200
I have something important

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.600
to tell you, Hill.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.480
But…

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.960
What is it, Junji?

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.720
You can tell me.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.200
I…

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.200
I don’t think I’ll be
coming back to Thailand.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.560
Jeans will also relocate to Japan.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.840
To find new inspiration.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.880
When I said I might not be back,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.120
it's because this project

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.960
is really big.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.880
Two years, at least.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.120
Junji.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.320
So we really won't get to be together?

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.680
If that's the case…

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.600
Can I ask you for one thing?

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.720
Junji.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.280
Hill.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.840
In Japan,

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.840
they're looking for a skilled Game Designer

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.960
for the project.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.720
I was asked to

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.920
invite you

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.760
to come work in Japan.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.680
You've only worked here for a year,

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.000
but

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.280
your work is amazing.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.000
Everyone recognized your work.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.160
Junji.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.000
I'm happy

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.480
about work,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:42.800
but

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.720
what makes me happiest

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.440
is the fact that I'll get to

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.480
hug you in person.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.000
No more sending you hugs through the phone.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.560
You really mean it?

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.440
Yeah.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.560
- Really?
- Really.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.000
Don't cry.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.160
Don't cry.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.080
Junji.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.160
You're late.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.960
Sorry.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.480
Shall we go?

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.840
Junji-san.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.800
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.480
Thank you for

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.040
always

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.080
supporting me.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.440
I love you.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.760
Without Yuka,

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.880
I wouldn’t be who I am today.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.320
But really,

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.320
I should be thanking you.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.240
Forget the past.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.160
Let's make new memories together.

Nice to meet you all.

Can you speak Japanese?

A little bit.
