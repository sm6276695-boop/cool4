So, what's your answer?

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:41.818
Would you rather find out what a real threat...

00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:44.348
feels like?

00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:43.408
My dad will take care of it.

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:46.318
Come on. That's blackmail, plain and simple.

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:50.048
Councilman, Blackmail? That's a strong word.

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:52.318
I'm proposing a negotiation. That's all.

00:02:53.018 --> 00:02:54.988
This is an illegal recording.

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:57.888

On an investigative show like "On-site Pursuit."

00:03:10.068 --> 00:03:12.238
To completely ruin someone's reputation.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:17.648
You said you wanted to negotiate, but you just keep threatening me.

00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:21.818
Do you have any other evidence? If you do, let's see it.

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.048
Other evidence?

00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:27.158
A few days ago, one of my employees...

00:03:27.518 --> 00:03:30.588
- was almost crushed in a junkyard. - Oh, my.

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:33.428
- Would you like to take a look? - Let me see.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:35.268
Here.

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:39.498
What is this?

00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:41.698
I'm sure you have no idea what this is.

00:03:42.468 --> 00:03:47.008
So, my employee fainted by this building...

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:50.678
and woke up at the Buhyeong Junkyard.

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:56.118
And it turns out, this car went from that building to the junkyard.

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:59.018
And my employee was in a car...

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:01.958
being processed for scrap. He got up from there...

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:05.698
and barely made it out alive.

00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:09.398
- So? - Sorry?

00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:13.768
Are you implying I have something to do with this car?

00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:16.468
I never said anything of the sort.

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:19.408
Why, Councilman? Are you?

00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:22.278
Look.

00:04:22.778 --> 00:04:25.278
I keep my public and private life separate.

00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:28.648
My son, Yong Min, may have his shortcomings,

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:31.348
I don't use my pull to cover for him.

00:04:31.348 --> 00:04:33.158
I would never do that.

00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:38.858
When someone shows you goodwill, you should accept it as such.

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.928
What do you think you're doing, coming here and threatening me?

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:48.908
Well, a threat can also be a negotiation.

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:51.708
To bad guys, it sounds like a threat,

00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:55.448
but to good people, a negotiation. That's just how it is.

00:04:58.578 --> 00:05:01.718
All right, fine. Then let's do this by the book.

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:03.788
Because I'm a public official,

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:08.928
and since I'm up for reelection, you must be here to extort me.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:11.258
Stop trying to pin this on an innocent man.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.158
Go back to your shop and stick to making your chicken tastier.

00:05:19.338 --> 00:05:21.768
- Tastier? - Yes.

00:05:30.248 --> 00:05:31.648
I apologize for the intrusion.

00:05:35.388 --> 00:05:37.018
(Coupon, Chicken Center)

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:38.118
Councilman,

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:41.688
so you've tried our chicken before.

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:43.258
Give me a call.

00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:45.358
(Future Leap Party)

00:05:54.598 --> 00:05:55.608
(Maheon Police Station)

00:05:55.608 --> 00:05:58.368
He'll be booked for auto arson. He was caught in the act.

00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:01.608
I'd like to add to the charges. In addition to auto arson,

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.308
destruction of property and assault.

00:06:03.678 --> 00:06:05.108
Please add verbal abuse.

00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:07.818
The motorcycle was parked in a commercial district,

00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:09.888
and the fire could've easily spread to the nearby buildings,

00:06:09.918 --> 00:06:11.988
which could have caused a massive fire.

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:15.288
You're full of it. Hey, you crazy jerk!

00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:16.428
What are you, her delivery gopher?

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:19.898
Also, the suspect has a history of harassing her with fake orders,

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:22.328
filing malicious complaints and even assaulting her.

00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:24.668
Miss, is he your lawyer?

00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:27.768
He's one of my employees.

00:06:29.168 --> 00:06:31.168
- Mister! - Mr. Shin.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:33.678
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:36.408
- No. - I'm fine.

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:38.748
What?

00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:42.488
What are you going to do, glare at me? Darn it.

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:46.458
Mr. Choi Yong Min?

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:49.828
Darn it.

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:53.358
Business owners really seem to know the law these days.

00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:56.268
With such a sharp employee, you must have no worries.

00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:58.898
Yes, I certainly do.

00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:00.998
Yong Min.

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:03.308
You really take after your father.

00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:11.708
So you took him down herself?

00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:14.618
- I'm telling you! - You did just like I taught you.

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:17.748
What are you teaching her, to fight instead of how to study?

00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:20.158
No, that's not it.

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:21.888
I was the one who asked him to teach me.

00:07:23.788 --> 00:07:26.698
But isn't Yong Pal just going to get out right away?

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:28.898
With his dad pulling some strings.

00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:31.668
Arson is a serious crime, so the only punishment is imprisonment.

00:07:31.668 --> 00:07:33.538
Criminal Act Article 166, Paragraph 1.

00:07:33.668 --> 00:07:36.668
A minimum of two years in prison. Even if he shows genuine remorse,

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:38.168
and even then, the best is a suspended sentence.

00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:42.348
In short, he's not getting out soon. So don't worry, Si On.

00:07:42.448 --> 00:07:45.748
How can I not worry? He set my motorcycle on fire.

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:47.848
That's my livelihood we're talking about.

00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:51.618
You're okay, and that's what matters. Right, Si On?

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:52.888
Wait for me.

00:07:53.518 --> 00:07:54.588
You guys go on ahead.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958
Where are you going?

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:59.558
I'll look for more evidence. I'm not comfortable with just arson.

00:07:59.728 --> 00:08:02.528
He's done so much wrong, so I'll find others to testify.

00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:04.368
Want me to come with you?

00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:05.768
No, I'll go by myself.

00:08:05.998 --> 00:08:07.098
I'll be back.

00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:08.638
Be careful.

00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:14.638
Yong Min never did anything like that to me.

00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:16.348
Please don't contact me again.

00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:18.078
Wait.

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:20.648
I don't really know him. I'm sorry.

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:23.518
Excuse me, do you know someone named Kwak Hyun Woo?

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:25.718
Is that the guy who used to live here?

00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:28.718
- I just moved in last year. - Can I help you with something?

00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:32.528
I'm looking for someone who moved into this neighborhood last year.

00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:36.398
- It's about a school violence case. - A school violence case?

00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:38.528
What's the student's name?

00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:48.948
- Oh, my. What happened here? - This way, Councilman.

00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:53.278
- Goodness. - Is anyone hurt?

00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:56.088
- What's the extent of the damage? - What does it look like?

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.958
My employee's motorcycle was completely torched,

00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:01.918
and people here could've been hurt.

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.188
I am so sorry.

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:04.788
But the worst part is...

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.458
- that your son threatened my staff. - Oh, my.

00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:12.838
Oh, I am so sorry. I've clearly failed as a father.

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:14.298
He's caused you so much trouble.

00:09:14.498 --> 00:09:16.738
I will do everything I can to compensate you for the damages.

00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:20.578
You have to pay for the damage. Don't act like it's a favor.

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:22.978
Let's go, Si On.

00:09:23.248 --> 00:09:24.248
Okay.

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:26.878
I'm sorry.

00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:33.718
Sir, let's step inside for a moment.

00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:34.818
I'll explain everything to you.

00:09:34.818 --> 00:09:36.158
Right, right. Let's go.

00:09:37.058 --> 00:09:38.088
My apologies.

00:09:39.598 --> 00:09:41.498
His dad seems like a decent guy, though.

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:44.768
So who does Yong Pal take after to be such a jerk?

00:09:44.828 --> 00:09:47.398
Who do you think? He takes after his father.

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:52.208
- Please, stay inside. - No, it's fine.

Gosh, Mr. Kwon.

00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:57.978
It's true for most things in life,

00:09:57.978 --> 00:10:00.218
but you just can't control your kids.

00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:01.778
Tell me about it.

00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:03.148
- All right. - Goodbye.

00:10:13.428 --> 00:10:15.428

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:18.428
Hey, you! Stand up straight.

00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:20.638
Stand up straight, you punk.

00:10:21.338 --> 00:10:23.608

or did I not tell you...

to keep a close eye on Yong Min?

00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:41.518
What? A million dollars?

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:07.118
Did you find a whole bunch of dirt or just one big scoop?

00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:11.288
I met with Choi Yong Min's victims. They didn't tell me it all,

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:13.658
but I'm looking for a solid witness.

00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:15.728
What about you, Mr. Shin?

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:18.628
- What? - You said you'd handle it your way.

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:21.458
I always do things my way.

00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:24.298
Here, take this.

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:33.338
Gosh.

00:11:34.578 --> 00:11:36.908
Why are you giving this to me?

00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:39.778
What, are you going to make deliveries on foot?

00:11:40.248 --> 00:11:42.718
- Give it to Si On tomorrow. - What?

00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.288
Did Choi Yong Min's dad give you this?

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.388
What did you say, punk?

00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:48.388
Then what?

00:11:48.718 --> 00:11:52.728
- Is it a birthday gift for Si On? - I bought this with my own money!

00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:54.358
Just kidding. It's a rental.

00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:57.628
But how do you know it's Si On's birthday?

00:11:57.898 --> 00:12:01.238
You said it at our last gathering. That her birthday was in two weeks.

00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:02.538
I did?

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:03.968
Actually,

00:12:04.368 --> 00:12:07.078
there's actually something I've been wanting to ask you.

00:12:07.178 --> 00:12:08.178
What is it?

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.678
Why do you go to such lengths for Si On?

00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:13.678
Why do you think? Take a good look around.

00:12:14.248 --> 00:12:18.218
The laundromat, Pluto, and me. We all live off deliveries, right?

00:12:18.348 --> 00:12:21.218
Which means Si On's motorcycle...

00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:22.888
is our livelihood.

00:12:23.358 --> 00:12:24.388
Makes sense, right?

00:12:25.798 --> 00:12:26.858
Hey, Pillip.

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:30.398
Si On has no idea what I'm thinking, right?

00:12:30.498 --> 00:12:31.928
- I wouldn't say that. - What?

00:12:32.028 --> 00:12:34.668
- It's super obvious. - It is?

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:39.208
Darn it. Anyway, Pillip, you watch out too.

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:41.008
If you fall for Si On,

00:12:41.538 --> 00:12:43.008
there's no way out.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:53.688
Gosh.

00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:12.368
Did you sleep well?

00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:14.508
What are you doing, trying to look cool in front of my place?

00:13:14.808 --> 00:13:15.848
Waiting for you.

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.308
- For the last hour. - What?

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:21.248
Are you an idiot?

00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:23.148
You should've just called.

00:13:23.448 --> 00:13:24.588
I didn't want to wake you.

00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:27.858
Mr. Shin said early in the morning. He didn't give me an exact time.

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.388
Mister did?

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.028
Come on, let's get the deliveries done.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:46.478
(Evergreen Milk)

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:49.008
Hurry up, will you?

00:13:49.948 --> 00:13:51.378
Swift and safe!

00:13:58.248 --> 00:13:59.588
(Evergreen Milk)

00:14:11.698 --> 00:14:12.838
(Evergreen Milk)

00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.058
Where'd you get the scooter?

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:40.458
Last night.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:41.998
From Mr. Shin.

00:14:44.068 --> 00:14:45.268
That's so like him.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:47.538
Hey.

00:14:47.798 --> 00:14:49.668
Where did you go after you left the police station yesterday?

00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:51.968
Here and there.

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:54.238
I already told you.

00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:56.748
That I was meeting a witness about what Choi Yong Min did.

00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:58.948
Why are you so invested in this thing with Yong Pal?

00:15:00.478 --> 00:15:02.478
It's because of what a judge once told me.

00:15:03.348 --> 00:15:04.518
(Cho Pillip)

00:15:04.948 --> 00:15:05.958
What?

00:15:06.318 --> 00:15:07.358
A prank?

00:15:07.718 --> 00:15:09.988
What prank is knocking a friend over,

00:15:09.988 --> 00:15:11.788
spitting on them while they're down,

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.328
and then stealing money from their wallet?

00:15:14.198 --> 00:15:16.868
I'm sending you both to juvenile hall.

00:15:17.128 --> 00:15:19.998
For every punch you threw, the law will punch back.

00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:22.908
It'll hit you with fines, and it'll hit you with a sentence.

00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:24.638
That is what a just world looks like.

00:15:25.038 --> 00:15:27.438
Your Honor, please have mercy just this once.

00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:29.378
No. I will not.

00:15:30.148 --> 00:15:33.078
Don't ask me for leniency. Take a good look at your son.

00:15:33.748 --> 00:15:37.688
Teach him the right and wrong way to treat a friend.

00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:39.988
This hearing is now concluded.

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:41.458
The court is adjourned.

00:15:44.988 --> 00:15:47.128
So that's why you wanted to become a judge?

00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:49.698
Yes, that's part of it.

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:53.668
What's important is Choi Yong Min gets the punishment he deserves,

00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:55.738
so his victims can finally hold their heads high.

00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.068
If you rob someone of their happiness,

00:15:58.568 --> 00:16:02.278
you must learn you can lose yours. That's just the way the world works.

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:11.118
(Whipped cream cake)

00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:13.418
- What's this? - Share it...

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:14.458
with your grandma and Ye On.

00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:20.928
Thank you.

00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:23.728
My gosh.

00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:26.198
What's with you being so charming this morning?

00:16:27.168 --> 00:16:29.408
Charming? Me?

00:16:30.068 --> 00:16:31.568
No, the judge.

00:16:39.308 --> 00:16:41.678
(Maheon Police Station)

00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:47.758
Here's the address for Kwak Hyun Woo's mother.

00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.228
Thank you. The school didn't know her address.

00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:56.198
I checked. They ruled his death a suicide and the case was closed.

00:16:57.228 --> 00:16:58.828
I'm this upset just hearing about it,

00:16:59.538 --> 00:17:01.098
so I can't imagine his mother's pain.

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:04.808
Anyway, I should get going.

00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:06.738
Take care.

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:16.318
Hello.

00:17:18.118 --> 00:17:20.018
My name is Cho Pillip.

00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:25.028
You're Kwak Hyun Woo's mother, aren't you?

00:17:26.998 --> 00:17:28.058
Oh, I...

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.508
I'm back.

00:17:38.338 --> 00:17:39.708
Where have you been?

00:17:41.238 --> 00:17:43.808
I'm the one doing all the work. Why do you look so worn out?

00:17:43.978 --> 00:17:45.608
A victim of Choi Yong Min's bullying...

00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:47.718
I met his mother.

00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:49.318
And?

00:17:51.818 --> 00:17:55.018
He was bullied by Choi Yong Min in his junior year in high school,

00:17:55.018 --> 00:17:56.018
so he transferred.

00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.188
But in the end, he took his own life.

00:17:59.728 --> 00:18:00.828
He's dead?

00:18:01.098 --> 00:18:04.368
He must have felt so wronged that he saw no other way out.

00:18:06.738 --> 00:18:09.738
- So, what did his mother say? - She said she had nothing to say.

00:18:09.968 --> 00:18:11.838
Even when I told her they'd caught Choi Yong Min,

00:18:12.108 --> 00:18:13.338
she said it doesn't matter.

00:18:13.638 --> 00:18:15.438
And you just left?

00:18:17.008 --> 00:18:18.008
Yes.

00:18:21.178 --> 00:18:23.088
You know, the first day of a negotiation...

00:18:23.418 --> 00:18:25.018
is like the first day of school.

00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:30.358
You listen, you observe, and you look for an opening.

00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:37.298
So, what's the most important part of that first meeting?

00:18:37.798 --> 00:18:40.138
Earning the other party's trust.

00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:43.308
And I guess I failed at that.

00:18:44.908 --> 00:18:48.208
That's why you have to show some bravado.

00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:53.248
You need to give them the impression that they can count on you.

00:18:53.748 --> 00:18:54.918
To her?

00:18:55.348 --> 00:18:56.348
Of course.

00:18:56.888 --> 00:19:00.618
Go back there right now and show her you're sincere.

00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:04.188
How else will she find the strength to fight?

00:19:05.058 --> 00:19:06.088
I'm on my way.

00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:09.398
Hey, Pillip! I wasn't finished...

00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:13.798
Gosh, but the next part was crucial. That kid...

00:19:19.608 --> 00:19:20.708
Ma'am!

00:19:22.978 --> 00:19:24.108
Ma'am!

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:26.748
Ma'am...

00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:31.118
Why are you here again?

00:19:31.188 --> 00:19:32.648
I may not look it, but I can fight.

00:19:32.648 --> 00:19:34.218
Third Dan black belt in Taekwondo, second Dan black belt in Geomdo.

00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:35.588
I can show you, if you like.

00:19:38.258 --> 00:19:40.028
No, I don't mean I'm here to fight.

00:19:41.828 --> 00:19:44.568
I was at the top of my class at Korean National Police University.

00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:46.768
And I passed the bar with top honors.

00:19:46.868 --> 00:19:49.338
And it's all to take down guys like Choi Yong Min.

00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:56.708
Please trust me, ma'am.

00:19:57.978 --> 00:19:59.178
Hyun Woo was wronged.

00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:03.688
And I promise, I will prove it.

00:20:10.128 --> 00:20:11.228
This is...

00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.798
Hyun Woo's journal.

00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:22.938
Thank you.

00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:41.918
(Chicken Center)

00:20:42.188 --> 00:20:44.828
So, will he cooperate and testify?

00:20:45.088 --> 00:20:47.958
Won't he have a change of heart if he knows how his friend felt?

00:20:48.128 --> 00:20:49.728
- And what if he doesn't? - What?

00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:53.938
If the world were so beautiful, why is Yong Pal still such a jerk?

00:20:53.998 --> 00:20:57.738
You forgot he tormented Si On and almost got you killed?

00:20:57.738 --> 00:20:59.368
No, I'm saying we gather the evidence slowly...

00:20:59.438 --> 00:21:02.478
And how long is it going to take to bring down the bad guys that way?

00:21:02.878 --> 00:21:06.948
I really didn't want to do this. Seriously.

00:21:07.778 --> 00:21:08.978
What are you going to do?

00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:11.518
Something big.

00:21:11.948 --> 00:21:13.958
- Something big? - Here it comes.

00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:15.918
Something big.

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:22.698
A man who set a motorcycle on fire and tried to flee a parking lot...

00:21:22.828 --> 00:21:27.038
was caught by citizens on the scene. The suspect is Mr. Choi.

00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:30.838
The man, who started the fire that could've led to a larger blaze,

00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:33.408
has been identified as the son of a Mawon city councilman.

00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:36.378
Oh, my goodness. What a mess!

00:21:36.408 --> 00:21:39.178
In that family, the son's the issue. Kids can be your worst enemy.

00:21:39.278 --> 00:21:40.278
Unbelievable.

00:21:40.318 --> 00:21:43.018
Funny how it's always the kids' fault.

00:21:43.018 --> 00:21:44.588
But making an enemy of your child...

00:21:44.618 --> 00:21:45.718
is on the parents.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:49.318
You know, you're right. You're absolutely right.

00:21:50.028 --> 00:21:51.028
All right, tell me this.

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:53.228
Let's say this is the last bottle of chocolate milk...

00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:55.158
in the whole store.

00:21:55.498 --> 00:21:58.328
Would you sell it to me? Or to Councilman Choi?

00:21:58.328 --> 00:21:59.328
What?

00:22:00.668 --> 00:22:02.398
- Is this a quiz? - Yes.

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:03.508
Oh, come on.

00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:07.808
To you, of course.

00:22:08.608 --> 00:22:10.648
- Right? - Right.

00:22:11.878 --> 00:22:15.248
That councilman's never bought so much as a pack of gum from me.

00:22:15.278 --> 00:22:17.718
Why ask when you already know? What do you take me for?

00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:20.418
- All right, have a good one. - Thanks.

00:22:20.418 --> 00:22:22.818
- I'm heading out. - Okay, take care.

00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:23.828
Bye.

00:22:25.158 --> 00:22:27.428
Mr. Jang, you know Councilman Choi, right?

00:22:28.728 --> 00:22:30.728
- Councilman Choi? - Yes.

00:22:31.128 --> 00:22:34.268
The punk who was harassing Si On is his son.

00:22:34.338 --> 00:22:37.908
The son deserves to be punished. But Councilman Choi's a good person.

00:22:37.908 --> 00:22:40.108
- Hey, where's my order? - Coming!

00:22:40.638 --> 00:22:42.938
He is? What's so good about him?

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:46.278
After COVID, when small businesses were going under left and right...

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.478
- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks, Mr. Jang.

00:22:48.748 --> 00:22:52.748
Now that the local currency's out, things should get a little better.

00:22:52.888 --> 00:22:55.458
We'll get through this together! Come on, let's do this.

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.658
- Mr. Jang! Let's do it! - Let's do it.

00:22:58.658 --> 00:23:01.498
Councilman Choi was the one who got us subsidies and tax breaks.

00:23:01.758 --> 00:23:03.828
You're a small business owner too, so you get it, don't you?

00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:06.398
I wouldn't know. I was unemployed back then.

00:23:06.738 --> 00:23:10.668
Anyway, Mr. Jang. So, are you with me or with him?

00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:14.278
Hey, what kind of question is that? Of course, my neighbor comes first.

00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:16.478
- You mean it? - Yes.

00:23:19.748 --> 00:23:22.418
Well, that's one vote secured.

00:23:26.858 --> 00:23:29.828
It's the son dragging his dad's name through the mud.

00:23:29.988 --> 00:23:33.198
Or maybe the father didn't raise him right?

00:23:33.458 --> 00:23:35.328
Councilman Choi's not like that.

00:23:35.628 --> 00:23:37.798
He's the only reason I've not been kicked out of my shop.

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:41.938
Everyone, please calm down. Now, Mr. Kim, please hear me out.

00:23:41.998 --> 00:23:45.568
Just because the lease is up, you can't kick these owners out.

00:23:45.638 --> 00:23:49.738
That's just not right. Until the redevelopment starts,

00:23:49.738 --> 00:23:51.778
the people who have shops here are the priority.

00:23:51.808 --> 00:23:55.548
Councilman Choi made Mr. Kim sign the new leases in front of us.

00:23:55.748 --> 00:23:58.318
He's the one councilman I actually respect.

00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:02.318
"Respect?" Give me a break. So, what's your point?

00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:04.058
So, whose side are you on? Mine or the councilman's?

00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:08.198
And what about you, Mr. Shin? Me or Councilman Choi?

00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:13.598
Gosh, what kind of question is that? Of course, I'm on your side.

00:24:15.768 --> 00:24:18.908
I'd pick you over the councilman. Happy?

00:24:23.608 --> 00:24:25.708
Hey, what do you think of this?

00:24:28.418 --> 00:24:29.418
What about what?

00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.458
My respected fellow merchants of the Hujin Arcade.

00:24:43.128 --> 00:24:45.268
And the good people of Maheon!

00:24:45.368 --> 00:24:47.738
And to all the distinguished guests...

00:24:47.768 --> 00:24:49.238
who have graced us with your presence.

00:24:49.398 --> 00:24:51.538
What's with the dramatic pose? What's he going to say?

00:24:52.108 --> 00:24:54.408
Even with your incredibly busy schedules,

00:24:54.478 --> 00:24:58.378
thank you for taking the time to be here today.

00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:01.418
I'm the one running the chicken joint over there,

00:25:01.748 --> 00:25:03.918
and the one who fries the chicken. I'm Shin Jay.

00:25:04.048 --> 00:25:05.748
With a solemn heart,

00:25:06.218 --> 00:25:09.858
I am officially declaring my candidacy...

00:25:10.588 --> 00:25:14.358
for the Maheon City Council.

00:25:18.068 --> 00:25:19.068
Did you hear that?

00:25:22.538 --> 00:25:23.568
Here it comes.

00:25:24.608 --> 00:25:26.008
Something big.

00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:27.438
There it is.

00:25:28.908 --> 00:25:29.908
Something big.

00:25:30.478 --> 00:25:31.508
All right, everyone!

00:25:31.808 --> 00:25:35.248
Our shopping center and Maheon are in a state of crisis.

00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:39.118
Our livelihoods are getting tougher, and business is suffering,

00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:43.588
and we have no clear vision for the future whatsoever.

00:25:43.688 --> 00:25:46.058
If we just sit around and do nothing,

00:25:46.388 --> 00:25:47.858
we're all going to go under.

00:25:48.528 --> 00:25:49.998
And so I, Shin Jay,

00:25:50.798 --> 00:25:53.128
for the sake of all our small business owners,

00:25:53.198 --> 00:25:56.368
will not only present a five-point vision...

00:25:56.498 --> 00:25:58.708
but I will ensure this five-point vision...

00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:00.808
Without fail,

00:26:01.308 --> 00:26:03.708
I'll absolutely make them happen.

00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:06.308
A round of applause, please!

00:26:07.248 --> 00:26:09.778
Mr. Shin, you're killing it!

00:26:12.518 --> 00:26:15.658
So, what are these five visions, you ask?

00:26:15.988 --> 00:26:17.758
- First. - Hey, where are you going?

00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:18.958
We all survive together.

00:26:19.758 --> 00:26:20.758
Second.

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:22.928
Even if it kills us, we survive together.

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:26.598
Third. No matter what happens,

00:26:26.938 --> 00:26:28.338
we all survive together.

00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:32.308
Gosh, my throat hurts.

00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:34.378
Are you seriously running for office?

00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:36.108
I just did, didn't I?

00:26:36.108 --> 00:26:39.548
Is that so? If you run, who will vote for you?

00:26:39.778 --> 00:26:42.378
Was anyone born a city councilman?

00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:45.148
Between the folks at the center and in the neighborhood,

00:26:45.418 --> 00:26:47.558
I've already secured at least a hundred votes.

00:26:47.688 --> 00:26:49.758
You've got my vote.

00:26:52.058 --> 00:26:54.628
I'll be your campaign finance chair, so don't worry about the money.

00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:55.898
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

00:26:56.028 --> 00:26:59.468
Hey, don't put ideas in his head. You don't even live here.

00:26:59.498 --> 00:27:01.168
You can't even vote for him, so why are you egging him on?

00:27:01.238 --> 00:27:03.868
Anyone can help out on a campaign!

00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:05.308
You'd think a judge would know that.

00:27:05.738 --> 00:27:07.778
So, why are you running?

00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:12.148
Simple. I'm Choi Woong Sik's biggest competition.

00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:17.488
Oh, it'd be amazing if you won instead of Yong Pal's dad.

00:27:17.988 --> 00:27:20.358
Well, I'm all for seeing Councilman Choi go down, but...

00:27:20.988 --> 00:27:22.718
Have you forgotten your place?

00:27:24.188 --> 00:27:27.698
- No, sir. - Gosh, way to rain on my parade.

00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:34.338
What?

00:27:36.068 --> 00:27:39.808
The Mr. Shin who hates attention and avoids crowded places...

00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:41.838
is running for office? Why?

00:27:41.838 --> 00:27:43.848
A city councilman has a lot of pull.

00:27:43.848 --> 00:27:45.248
Enough to cover up his son's school bullying...

00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:46.478
and even a violent assault.

00:27:46.778 --> 00:27:47.778
Cover up what?

00:27:47.848 --> 00:27:50.218
Every single thing he did wrong. Right?

00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:54.458
Look, I'm doing this to protect my family.

00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:56.318
But there have to be other ways besides running for office.

00:27:56.388 --> 00:28:00.358
He's an incumbent city councilman. I have to meet him on his level.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.740
That'll make the match more exciting, don't you think?

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.710
Because of judicial ethics, neither Pillip nor I can help you.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.710
Hey, who said I needed help? I have...

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.280
a grand plan of my own.

00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:15.042
I present to you my five-point vision.

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:17.682
Yes, I like it!

00:28:17.912 --> 00:28:20.112
- Okay. - One more time.

00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:22.012
Sure. My five-point...

00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:25.952
Let's head to the next location.

00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:27.892
(Warning: defacement is prohibited)

00:28:27.952 --> 00:28:29.952
(Bulldozer Drive! Choi Woong Sik)

00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:31.022
(Kwon Bong Geun)

00:28:32.592 --> 00:28:36.092
Unbelievable. What a phony.

00:28:38.062 --> 00:28:39.962
(Bulldozer Drive! Choi Woong Sik)

00:28:46.272 --> 00:28:47.442
(Shin Jay)

00:28:47.442 --> 00:28:48.512
All right.

00:28:52.682 --> 00:28:53.682
(Kwon Chil Bong)

00:28:55.782 --> 00:28:57.852
Well, look at this guy.

00:28:58.752 --> 00:29:00.422
This is my seventh time running.

00:29:00.792 --> 00:29:03.592
I made up my mind 28 years ago when my eldest was born.

00:29:03.822 --> 00:29:06.232
To make this world a better place for our children.

00:29:06.932 --> 00:29:09.832
Until I fulfill that calling, I will never give up.

00:29:11.402 --> 00:29:13.432
Let's have a clean race, Mr. Shin.

00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:21.972
(I'll listen and make a change)

00:29:22.042 --> 00:29:23.042
(Shin Jay gets it done differently!)

00:29:27.752 --> 00:29:30.022
(Shin Jay, Independent)

00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:34.892
Vote for Number 1. Thank you!

00:29:34.992 --> 00:29:38.962
Hello there! Thank you, thank you! I hope you've all been well.

00:29:39.092 --> 00:29:42.192
- Your son is in trouble. - How can you run for office?

00:29:42.262 --> 00:29:45.462
Hey, you people! Whose kids don't cause trouble?

00:29:45.532 --> 00:29:49.102
- It can happen to anyone, right? - Anyway, Councilman.

00:29:49.172 --> 00:29:50.872
The Jangsuk-dong development is still on, right?

00:29:50.942 --> 00:29:54.442
Oh, you bet. Absolutely. Now, everyone, my biggest promise...

00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:57.412
to build a greater Maheon City! That's what this is about!

00:29:57.482 --> 00:29:59.582
I'll ensure everyone is prosperous,

00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:00.782
with roofs overhead and full bellies!

00:30:00.852 --> 00:30:02.652
That is my promise to you, everyone!

00:30:03.922 --> 00:30:07.822
Choi Woong Sik! Choi Woong Sik!

00:30:11.622 --> 00:30:14.762
Yay or Nay? Yay or Nay? The Yay or Nay Show!

00:30:15.092 --> 00:30:17.032
The local elections have begun.

00:30:17.102 --> 00:30:20.032
We'll now take a look at the current polling numbers in each district.

00:30:20.232 --> 00:30:23.802
In Maheon City, a showdown between Councilman Choi Woong Sik...

00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:27.042
and candidate Kwon Bong Geun, in a tight two-man race.

00:30:27.172 --> 00:30:29.982
Candidate 3, Kwon Bong Geun, is polling at 31 percent,

00:30:30.082 --> 00:30:32.242
and is closing in on Choi Woong Sik.

00:30:32.712 --> 00:30:34.282
If his supporters really turn out,

00:30:34.352 --> 00:30:37.252
- he could have a chance, right? - He's up against the front-runner,

00:30:37.322 --> 00:30:40.952
but there's a 12-point gap. Even if his base rallies,

00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:44.292
I'm not so sure the tides will turn.

00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:49.532
Wronged and unheard? Vote Shin Jay! Number 9, Shin Jay!

00:30:49.662 --> 00:30:51.432
Vote Number 9, Shin Jay!

00:30:51.502 --> 00:30:53.472
Candidate 9, the chicken shop owner.

00:30:53.472 --> 00:30:55.772
His approval rating is under 1percent.

00:30:55.832 --> 00:30:59.342
- Should we even mention him? - I guess we have to.

00:30:59.402 --> 00:31:02.242
It's not the candidate himself, but one of his campaigners.

00:31:02.312 --> 00:31:05.282
A food firm chairman is on his team.

00:31:05.357 --> 00:31:08.397
- He's better known, right? - I mean, it's true.

00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:12.052
Park Myeong Jin of Cheonin Food. He heads a major corporation,

00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:15.722
and he's even helping the campaign. It makes you wonder...

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:18.792
if there was some kind of special connection from way back.

00:31:19.122 --> 00:31:20.632
Number 9, Shin Jay!

00:31:22.562 --> 00:31:25.402
Number 7! Kwon Chil Bong!

00:31:25.462 --> 00:31:30.342
Number 7, Kwon Chil Bong With an iron in each hand

00:31:30.402 --> 00:31:32.702
He'll iron out all your problems

00:31:32.702 --> 00:31:33.942
This is Shin Jay!

00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:37.412
Shin Jay!

00:31:39.482 --> 00:31:40.852
How childish.

00:31:43.052 --> 00:31:44.882
Kwon Chil Bong!

00:31:46.392 --> 00:31:50.162
Kwon Chil Bong! Next up, Candidate 7.

00:31:50.222 --> 00:31:53.462
Candidate Kwon Chil Bong is a Maheon City election legend.

00:31:53.562 --> 00:31:57.332
This is his seventh run in almost 30 years,

00:31:57.432 --> 00:32:00.572
- and he's polling at 1 percent. - Wow, almost 30 years?

00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:03.472
- He's been running since the 2000s. - That's right.

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:06.002
Well, you've got to give him credit for his persistence.

00:32:10.182 --> 00:32:14.812
It really seems like we have a very diverse slate of candidates.

00:32:14.882 --> 00:32:18.552
In Maheon City, in particular, many have unique platforms.

00:32:18.882 --> 00:32:20.752
- That's right. - Oh, excuse me.

00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:23.722
- Director. - Oh, yes.

00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:25.362
This lemon color was a great choice.

00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:26.562
I know, it's a great color.

00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:27.692
We're going to the park next, right?

00:32:27.732 --> 00:32:29.332
- That's right. - I'll go on ahead.

00:32:29.392 --> 00:32:30.502
Okay, I'll be right behind you.

00:32:31.802 --> 00:32:35.832
Look at you in that vest.

00:32:37.502 --> 00:32:39.442
You two are normally fighting. What gives?

00:32:39.502 --> 00:32:41.942
Hey, if I don't help Chil Bong out, who will?

00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:43.012
Oh, listen to you.

00:32:43.512 --> 00:32:44.612
The noodles would've gotten soggy,

00:32:44.982 --> 00:32:46.782
so I brought you some mandu and shrimp toast.

00:32:47.482 --> 00:32:50.252
Come on, take it. I should get back to campaigning.

00:32:52.082 --> 00:32:54.052
- Thanks, I'll enjoy it. - Yes.

00:32:54.122 --> 00:32:55.752
- Here, share this with the others. - Okay, thanks so much.

00:32:55.752 --> 00:32:57.792
Mr. Shin!

00:32:57.862 --> 00:33:00.532
- What is it? Is someone hurt? - Mr. Shin, look at this.

00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:01.592
What?

00:33:02.462 --> 00:33:03.462
What's this?

00:33:03.932 --> 00:33:05.532
Food poisoning from the fried chicken?

00:33:05.832 --> 00:33:06.832
Unbelievable.

00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:10.842
Hello? What's up?

00:33:10.902 --> 00:33:12.372
Mr. Shin, get to the restaurant.

00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:13.642
What, right now?

00:33:14.072 --> 00:33:17.142
Folks, I was so betrayed, I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

00:33:17.342 --> 00:33:19.582
I told everyone this place was great,

00:33:19.852 --> 00:33:22.112
and they gave people food poisoning? Oh my chicken!

00:33:22.182 --> 00:33:23.752
- That's Kkokkio, - I'm telling you. Kkokkio.

00:33:23.822 --> 00:33:26.822
I'm here at the scene of the crime to expose the truth!

00:33:27.052 --> 00:33:30.022
Right now, inside, the health inspectors are all here.

00:33:30.162 --> 00:33:32.492
Let's go take a look inside.

00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:34.462
If even Kkokkio is here, this must be serious.

00:33:34.892 --> 00:33:35.892
Really? I know, right?

00:33:35.962 --> 00:33:40.102
He's busy running for City Council, so he's neglecting hygiene.

00:33:40.672 --> 00:33:43.372
Let's see for ourselves. Ta-da!

00:33:43.972 --> 00:33:45.172
The oil is perfectly clean.

00:33:46.342 --> 00:33:47.372
(Fresh, Domestic Chicken: Pass)

00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:48.472
Pass!

00:33:48.472 --> 00:33:49.542
Fresh cabbage.

00:33:49.612 --> 00:33:50.612
Pass.

00:33:50.682 --> 00:33:53.252
(CCTV Hygiene Inspection: Pass)

00:33:53.312 --> 00:33:55.112
Anyway, nothing to worry about here.

00:33:55.382 --> 00:33:58.152
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:34:00.192 --> 00:34:01.552
- What did I just witness? - Have a nice day.

00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:02.622
Right.

00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:03.722
Okay, okay. Go on in.

00:34:09.362 --> 00:34:12.462
Everyone, this is exactly what's happening in this election!

00:34:12.602 --> 00:34:16.372
This is an attempt to sabotage Candidate No. 9, Shin Jay!

00:34:16.442 --> 00:34:19.072
This is a setup by my political opponents.

00:34:19.872 --> 00:34:24.112
This is our chance to clean house! Candidate No. 9, Shin Jay...

00:34:24.182 --> 00:34:25.482
will bring that change. For all of you!

00:34:29.922 --> 00:34:31.452
It's time for you to go.

00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:37.522
(Chicken Center)

00:34:45.162 --> 00:34:46.432
Great job, Si On.

00:34:47.602 --> 00:34:49.232
- Mr. Shin. - Yeah?

00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:51.142
- The photo. - What?

00:34:52.072 --> 00:34:53.102
Wait, what's this about?

00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:56.342
No, look at the hand reflected in the mirror.

00:34:56.842 --> 00:34:57.912
See the tattoo?

00:34:59.082 --> 00:35:00.712
I saw it last night when I was making a delivery.

00:35:02.652 --> 00:35:05.622
It was my first delivery there, so I remember it perfectly.

00:35:06.252 --> 00:35:07.252
Oh, really?

00:35:07.852 --> 00:35:09.152
So where is this?

00:35:09.752 --> 00:35:13.532
Oh, I'm so sorry. I heard you got food poisoning?

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:18.132
This chicken's fresh, so no worries. Relax and enjoy.

00:35:18.662 --> 00:35:20.802
- Hey, Si On. - Here.

00:35:20.872 --> 00:35:24.242
After you finish your meal, take your time and...

00:35:24.302 --> 00:35:25.402
read this.

00:35:25.842 --> 00:35:26.942
What's this?

00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:28.872
A complaint.

00:35:29.142 --> 00:35:31.782
A complaint for defamation and making a false report.

00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:35.582
Hey, Si On, what's the total fine for all this?

00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:38.252
Defamation carries a sentence of up to five years in prison,

00:35:38.322 --> 00:35:40.322
suspension of rights for 10 years or up to a 10,000-dollar fine.

00:35:41.592 --> 00:35:42.652
And for filing a false accusation,

00:35:42.722 --> 00:35:45.292
that's up to 10 years in prison,

00:35:45.962 --> 00:35:49.062
and a fine of 15,000 dollars, I believe.

00:35:50.832 --> 00:35:53.502
Wow. You add all that up, how many chickens is that?

00:35:53.572 --> 00:35:54.802
Tell me about it.

00:35:55.632 --> 00:35:57.002
Enjoy your meal.

00:35:57.272 --> 00:35:58.272
Let's go.

00:35:59.242 --> 00:36:00.612
Excuse me, sir.

00:36:01.372 --> 00:36:03.172
Yeah? What is it?

00:36:03.242 --> 00:36:04.242
Something on your mind?

00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:05.912
Go on.

00:36:06.782 --> 00:36:08.282
K-soup and rice.

00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:12.152
The warm, comforting soup just like Mom used to make.

00:36:12.222 --> 00:36:15.492
And a bowl of rice. A taste of pure happiness.

00:36:16.962 --> 00:36:17.962
Hello?

00:36:19.422 --> 00:36:20.432
Hey!

00:36:20.962 --> 00:36:21.962
Look...

00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:26.462
What? You think all I do is eat? I eat three square meals a day.

00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:30.242
I'm not asking you to pay for my food, so why give me a hard time?

00:36:36.912 --> 00:36:37.912
I've read...

00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:39.842
the diary.

00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:43.012
But I don't think I can testify.

00:36:44.522 --> 00:36:45.852
I feel bad for Hyun Woo,

00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:49.922
but it's not like this will bring Hyun Woo back.

00:36:51.462 --> 00:36:52.462
I'm sorry.

00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:56.802
Hold on.

00:37:00.032 --> 00:37:01.572
I remember what that was like.

00:37:02.232 --> 00:37:04.172
Hoping that someone, anyone at all, would help.

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:07.012
I was lucky enough to have someone like that,

00:37:07.742 --> 00:37:11.782
and I hope you can be that for Hyun Woo.

00:37:12.942 --> 00:37:14.112
I know what it's like from my experience.

00:37:30.302 --> 00:37:32.602
Do you think Yong Pal's Dad could be behind this?

00:37:33.002 --> 00:37:35.332
- So he could win the election. - Mr. Shin.

00:37:35.972 --> 00:37:36.972
Yeah?

00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:41.912
Unbelievable. Who wears shoes in someone's house?

00:37:41.972 --> 00:37:45.412
It seems Kyung Hwan's dad took money for his grandma's hospital bills.

00:37:45.482 --> 00:37:46.882
That's why he couldn't testify.

00:37:46.952 --> 00:37:49.922
This looks pretty disturbing. What's the sentence for this?

00:37:50.382 --> 00:37:53.082
Per Criminal Code Article 115, for destruction of evidence,

00:37:53.222 --> 00:37:56.022
he could get up to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to 7,000 dollars.

00:37:56.192 --> 00:37:58.262
But it might not be an easy win in court.

00:38:01.892 --> 00:38:04.432
Man, I'm beat. Get me a coffee.

00:38:04.502 --> 00:38:06.732
- You're here. - Hey, it's Player Kim.

00:38:07.102 --> 00:38:08.102
Hello.

00:38:08.172 --> 00:38:11.642
Well, Si On. Long time no see.

00:38:12.602 --> 00:38:13.772
Feeling a little hip today, aren't you?

00:38:14.372 --> 00:38:18.112
Of course. Game recognizes game.

00:38:24.652 --> 00:38:29.122
Man, I used up my vacation days chasing that 'I Love You' guy.

00:38:29.192 --> 00:38:33.362
- It was a huge pain in the neck. - Hey, Player Kim, what is all this?

00:38:33.432 --> 00:38:36.562
Here. Start from here.

00:38:36.802 --> 00:38:40.032
"Suddenly, my boss shows up and tells me to go to a work dinner."

00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:44.402
"We had Jeju pork belly with rind. I ate eight servings of it, and then"

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:48.542
"I moved the car with a forklift. And as I was about to crush it,"

00:38:48.912 --> 00:38:53.852
"a guy popped out of the trunk." This is about you, right?

00:38:53.982 --> 00:38:55.252
- Yeah. - Right.

00:38:55.312 --> 00:38:58.782
There's more. "Are you still here illegally?"

00:38:58.852 --> 00:39:02.752
"Hey, you're illegal too." "Man, I got my green card."

00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:07.032
"My boss's friend's a councilman. He hooked me up."

00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:09.562
- Isn't that a smoking gun? - You know it.

00:39:09.632 --> 00:39:11.062
He doesn't name names.

00:39:12.102 --> 00:39:14.402
They don't say who the boss's city councilman friend is.

00:39:16.272 --> 00:39:18.772
So you're saying we have a mountain of evidence,

00:39:19.042 --> 00:39:20.542
but no knockout punch.

00:39:20.672 --> 00:39:23.842
Correct. The chicken post payment was anonymous,

00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:25.512
so it's hard to prove a connection.

00:39:25.612 --> 00:39:27.782
The video will be blamed on Kyung Hwan.

00:39:27.852 --> 00:39:31.052
They could flip the narrative, so we need more evidence.

00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:35.692
- What about the junkyard? - We must link it to Choi Woong Sik.

00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:38.692
That's the only way we can make sure Choi Young Min gets punished too.

00:39:40.892 --> 00:39:43.032
Looks like there's only one way to do this.

00:39:45.632 --> 00:39:47.272
I have to see it through to the end.

00:39:49.172 --> 00:39:50.272
The election.

00:39:52.942 --> 00:39:55.272
- Here you go. - Thanks.

00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:57.742
Be careful not to get gum on it when you sit down,

00:39:57.842 --> 00:40:01.652
and try not to get makeup on it. It's a pain to get out.

00:40:02.252 --> 00:40:05.952
Since this is the only one I have, you're always stuck washing it.

00:40:06.352 --> 00:40:10.462
Thanks. I'm surprised you'd lend me your rival's campaign outfit.

00:40:11.362 --> 00:40:16.092
This thing is so tacky. Next time, get a simple one like me.

00:40:16.292 --> 00:40:18.662
This vest has been through three elections already.

00:40:19.132 --> 00:40:21.402
I had it made for my fifth run.

00:40:22.072 --> 00:40:23.742
You'll brag about anything, won't you?

00:40:25.372 --> 00:40:27.372
By the way...

00:40:27.672 --> 00:40:29.812
Who do you consider your biggest rival?

00:40:31.442 --> 00:40:32.982
Let's see...

00:40:33.552 --> 00:40:35.712
Well, he has that whole thing with his son,

00:40:35.782 --> 00:40:38.582
Choi Woong Sik has the best shot at winning.

00:40:38.782 --> 00:40:41.892
He forms a unified front at crucial moments to consolidate the votes.

00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:43.292
A unified front?

00:40:43.352 --> 00:40:45.892
Yeah. He has a way of winning people over.

00:40:45.962 --> 00:40:50.162
What about Candidate Kwon Bong Geun? His polls seemed pretty high too.

00:40:50.232 --> 00:40:52.962
Oh, he's a great guy.

00:40:53.202 --> 00:40:57.302
But he's too idealistic. That's why he's no match for me.

00:41:03.442 --> 00:41:05.482
Candidate Kwon, this is a legal notice for you.

00:41:05.542 --> 00:41:08.812
Stop bringing me threatening letters and bring me some actual evidence.

00:41:08.882 --> 00:41:12.552
You used herbicide on Mt. Madeung, a designated environmental district,

00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:15.192
so first, you need to explain why you downgraded its status.

00:41:15.252 --> 00:41:18.992
Maheon City, explain yourselves!

00:41:19.062 --> 00:41:22.062
Explain! Explain!

00:41:22.262 --> 00:41:25.502
- Explain the Jangsuk-dong project! - Isn't he just putting on a show...

00:41:25.562 --> 00:41:27.772
- Explain! - to get something...

00:41:27.772 --> 00:41:28.832
- Explain! - out of the city or the builders?

00:41:29.502 --> 00:41:32.642
As if. For ten years, he's been chasing the thankless jobs.

00:41:32.772 --> 00:41:34.672
If that were true, he'd be rich by now.

00:41:35.572 --> 00:41:39.382
If he gets elected, he'll work hard for the people.

00:41:40.012 --> 00:41:41.952
With me and Choi Woong Sik competing,

00:41:42.382 --> 00:41:44.752
the best he can hope for is 3rd place.

00:41:52.992 --> 00:41:54.192
What's with that look?

00:41:55.062 --> 00:41:56.692
Candidate Kwon, you and I...

00:41:56.962 --> 00:42:00.672
both want a better Maheon City, yes? Isn't that what this is all about?

00:42:00.832 --> 00:42:01.832
Of course.

00:42:01.902 --> 00:42:06.242
Look, if we form a coalition,

00:42:06.342 --> 00:42:10.612
what can't we accomplish? We can speed up development twofold.

00:42:11.382 --> 00:42:12.482
Candidate Choi.

00:42:13.382 --> 00:42:15.182
My idea of development...

00:42:15.312 --> 00:42:18.482
isn't achieved by harming nature and kicking people out of their homes.

00:42:19.052 --> 00:42:21.852
True development is when we all prosper together.

00:42:26.762 --> 00:42:27.862
I should've known.

00:42:28.132 --> 00:42:30.662
You're still so young, Candidate Kwon.

00:42:32.062 --> 00:42:33.062
If we do things your way,

00:42:33.502 --> 00:42:35.832
we'll be the only ones left in the dust.

00:42:35.902 --> 00:42:38.902
I'm sorry, but I can't share your vision.

00:42:40.372 --> 00:42:41.372
Excuse me.

00:42:41.442 --> 00:42:43.372
(Today it's the salamanders, tomorrow it's us)

00:42:49.252 --> 00:42:50.982
Darn it.

00:42:51.282 --> 00:42:52.282
Hey, give me a smoke.

00:42:55.452 --> 00:42:59.222
Look, we already have the permit, so just bulldoze the whole thing.

00:42:59.522 --> 00:43:02.292
Your ratings aren't climbing enough, so I think they're playing it safe.

00:43:03.032 --> 00:43:04.832
Is this punk out of his mind?

00:43:05.932 --> 00:43:08.872
How are my ratings supposed to go up if we don't break ground?

00:43:08.932 --> 00:43:12.442
We need shovels in the ground. Just bulldoze it all.

00:43:12.942 --> 00:43:13.942
Yes, sir.

00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:16.742
The expenses just keep piling up.

00:43:17.112 --> 00:43:21.252
Money's pouring out of my pockets.

00:43:28.122 --> 00:43:29.822
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:43:31.492 --> 00:43:35.332
In other news. Last night in Jangsuk-dong,

00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:39.362
a clash broke out between residents and a demo crew forcing an eviction.

00:43:39.432 --> 00:43:42.402
Council candidate Kwon Bong Geun, who was at the scene,

00:43:42.472 --> 00:43:45.442
and a dozen residents were injured.

00:43:45.502 --> 00:43:46.542
Candidate Kwon.

00:43:47.172 --> 00:43:50.312
- Oh, thank you for coming. - Are you all right, sir?

00:43:51.182 --> 00:43:54.412
It's not broken, just a fracture.

00:43:54.712 --> 00:43:56.922
I'm just so relieved no residents were badly hurt.

00:43:56.982 --> 00:43:59.752
Still, why did you block that with your bare body?

00:43:59.752 --> 00:44:01.552
Why go to such lengths?

00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:05.122
Because their relocation issue hasn't been resolved yet.

00:44:05.692 --> 00:44:06.822
But the Jangsuk-dong development...

00:44:07.162 --> 00:44:08.462
Didn't 70 percent of residents approve it?

00:44:08.532 --> 00:44:09.692
That may be true, but...

00:44:10.302 --> 00:44:12.432
the majority isn't always right, is it?

00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:16.332
Also, the environmental pollution here is extremely serious.

00:44:16.402 --> 00:44:20.172
But the majority wants development so they can live more prosperously.

00:44:20.772 --> 00:44:22.342
And you're the one standing in their way.

00:44:24.042 --> 00:44:25.112
Candidate Kim.

00:44:25.842 --> 00:44:28.452
What does it really mean to "live more prosperously"?

00:44:29.852 --> 00:44:31.882
If we continue to destroy nature as we are,

00:44:31.952 --> 00:44:36.852
we'll lose our ability to survive. And those residents...

00:44:36.922 --> 00:44:40.432
have lived here all their lives. You can't just toss them out.

00:44:40.562 --> 00:44:41.962
That's just wrong, isn't it?

00:44:42.692 --> 00:44:46.802
We have to protect them. Especially as a local candidate.

00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:48.902
(Future Forward Party Candidate for Maheon City Council)

00:44:48.972 --> 00:44:50.772
(Choi Woong Sik)

00:45:06.482 --> 00:45:11.262
With Choi and Lee joining forces for the Maheon election,

00:45:11.322 --> 00:45:13.892
the gap in the polls has widened significantly.

00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:17.702
Candidate Choi is polling at 49.2 percent,

00:45:17.762 --> 00:45:19.732
pulling far ahead of Candidate Kwon Bong Geun at 30 percent.

00:45:20.132 --> 00:45:23.002
Choi Woong Sik was all over the news for the incident with his son,

00:45:23.072 --> 00:45:25.642
I thought it would be a game-changer,

00:45:25.702 --> 00:45:27.912
but it seems he's locking it in.

00:45:27.972 --> 00:45:28.972
He's got to lock it in.

00:45:29.842 --> 00:45:32.212
Make sure you vote for Candidate Number 1!

00:45:32.282 --> 00:45:35.452
All eyes on Choi Woong Sik!

00:45:35.512 --> 00:45:39.152
- Candidate 1, Choi Woong Sik! - Choi Woong Sik!

00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:43.922
- It's Choi Woong Sik! - Choi Woong Sik!

00:45:43.992 --> 00:45:45.492
Thank you, everyone.

00:45:47.332 --> 00:45:48.562
Please, take a look at this.

00:45:59.772 --> 00:46:03.072
So you're saying Choi Woong Sik is behind all of this?

00:46:03.272 --> 00:46:04.582
Yes, that's correct.

00:46:04.912 --> 00:46:08.382
All right. If we form a unified ticket...

00:46:08.482 --> 00:46:10.822
- I'm out. - What?

00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:13.422
We can't unify our campaigns just to oppose someone...

00:46:13.482 --> 00:46:14.852
if we don't even agree on policy.

00:46:16.122 --> 00:46:18.062
Besides, this is a matter for the police,

00:46:18.322 --> 00:46:19.792
not something we can solve by unifying.

00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:24.502
Well, then.

00:46:25.162 --> 00:46:26.932
Candidate Kwon.

00:46:28.232 --> 00:46:29.232
Well, then.

00:46:37.082 --> 00:46:39.642
But we still have to stop Choi Woong Sik somehow, don't we?

00:46:40.582 --> 00:46:43.152
I agree. Choi Woong Sik cannot be allowed to win.

00:46:44.982 --> 00:46:47.222
That's right. Now, fellow candidates,

00:46:47.492 --> 00:46:48.792
if the three of us team up...

00:46:49.122 --> 00:46:52.022
we can completely change the outcome of this election.

00:46:52.892 --> 00:46:53.892
How?

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.062
A unified front?

00:46:57.032 --> 00:46:58.932
They're all talking about it.

The election race in Maheon City is in turmoil.

Last night, protesting the attempted forced demolition in Jangsuk-dong,

00:47:23.192 --> 00:47:26.662
Lee Gwang Mun and Kim Wan Jae unified to back Kwon Bong Geun,

00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:31.502
while Do Tae Woo and Lee Ye Seul have unified to support Shin Jay.

00:47:31.732 --> 00:47:35.702
Previously, Choi Woong Sik shot up in the polls by forming an alliance.

00:47:35.832 --> 00:47:38.802
But now Candidate Kwon Bong Geun is hot on his heels again.

00:47:39.002 --> 00:47:41.772
Jangsuk-dong, where the greenbelt zoning was lifted two years ago,

00:47:41.872 --> 00:47:46.582
is key to a major development plan, making it a key battleground.

00:47:51.252 --> 00:47:53.452
That's strange.

00:47:54.452 --> 00:47:58.262
What would Councilman Choi be doing at my restaurant?

00:47:58.722 --> 00:48:01.532
Want me to fry you up some chicken? Make it extra special for you?

00:48:04.862 --> 00:48:09.272
I see. You're hungry for my 5.8 percent of the vote.

00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:16.242
Mr. Shin, you should start reading fortunes.

00:48:17.442 --> 00:48:21.552
Unify our campaigns. If you do, it's a guaranteed win.

00:48:21.612 --> 00:48:25.722
That 5.8 percent isn't on the menu. And it's very expensive.

00:48:30.452 --> 00:48:34.632
You think I'd see a top negotiator empty-handed?

00:48:38.062 --> 00:48:39.062
Oh, please.

00:48:41.272 --> 00:48:45.002
All right, then, I'll take that as a yes.

But I do have one condition.

00:48:59.152 --> 00:49:00.952
Meet it, and you'll have my support.

00:49:04.322 --> 00:49:06.022

take this as well.

To Hyun Woo's mother, this is Choi Woong Sik.

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:30.682
I know I should be there to apologize in person, but...

00:50:31.142 --> 00:50:33.142
I wanted to reach out this way first.

00:50:34.052 --> 00:50:36.782
On behalf of my son, I offer my sincerest apologies.

00:50:36.852 --> 00:50:37.952
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

I'll get you out of here right away. I'll deal with that scum for good.

00:51:21.292 --> 00:51:23.892

00:54:30.597 --> 00:54:32.727
Hey, is this what I asked for?

00:54:32.797 --> 00:54:35.667
Yes, this is what you asked for.

00:54:35.767 --> 00:54:39.767
This was a real pain to get. Nice work.

00:54:40.137 --> 00:54:42.737
Help yourself to a cold drink from the fridge.

00:54:44.737 --> 00:54:45.807
Chil Bong.

00:54:46.337 --> 00:54:47.547
You've worked hard.

00:54:49.047 --> 00:54:50.347
It's not over yet.

00:54:50.617 --> 00:54:53.377
Come on, the campaign's over.

00:54:54.387 --> 00:54:57.517
We'll get good results this time.

00:54:57.657 --> 00:54:59.757
I've got a really strong feeling about this.

00:55:00.987 --> 00:55:04.827
What's this? Eating without me? I see how it is.

00:55:04.997 --> 00:55:06.257
Mr. Shin, welcome.

00:55:06.527 --> 00:55:09.567
Oh, Mr. Shin. Please, have a seat.

00:55:10.437 --> 00:55:12.397
Wow, what a spread.

00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:16.207
You may not have finished the race, but you've been through a lot.

00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:20.677
I've had my share of hurdles to get this far, too.

00:55:21.277 --> 00:55:22.507
But still...

00:55:22.877 --> 00:55:24.777
if you hang on till the end...

00:55:25.777 --> 00:55:28.247
Candidate Kwon. Perfect timing.

00:55:28.317 --> 00:55:30.587
- You're all here early. - Yes. Welcome.

00:55:30.717 --> 00:55:33.627
What's he doing here now?

00:55:34.027 --> 00:55:35.027
Well...

00:55:36.487 --> 00:55:38.027
Why...

00:55:47.307 --> 00:55:49.537
Let's see here.

00:55:52.877 --> 00:55:56.607
Here it is. Yedong Kwon Clan, Chungnyeolgong.

The 38th-generation descendant. With the generational name "Bong."

00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:03.387
That's who I am.

00:56:03.687 --> 00:56:06.587
Oh, really? In that case, let me see.

00:56:06.987 --> 00:56:07.987
Let's see...

00:56:11.327 --> 00:56:14.827
Here I am. The 35th-generation, and the generational name is "Geun."

00:56:14.897 --> 00:56:17.567
I'm the 35th-generation descendant, Kwon Bong Geun.

00:56:19.597 --> 00:56:20.607
Which means...

00:56:22.107 --> 00:56:24.307
- My dear great-grandson. - Yes.

00:56:25.007 --> 00:56:27.177
- Great-grandfather. - Oh, give me a break, Chil Bong.

00:56:27.507 --> 00:56:29.807
Do you know what I hate more than anything?

00:56:30.177 --> 00:56:33.917
When relatives fight tooth and nail over a single position.

00:56:34.017 --> 00:56:36.687
I can't stand the sight of it. Don't you agree?

00:56:36.747 --> 00:56:39.287
The Yedong Kwon Clan. The Chungnyeolgong Branch.

00:56:39.387 --> 00:56:42.227
The 35th and 38th-generation descendants, don't you agree?

00:56:49.597 --> 00:56:51.867
- Great-grandfather. - Oh, yes.

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:53.367
I...

00:56:57.237 --> 00:57:00.407
- concede. - Fine, I'll concede.

00:57:02.347 --> 00:57:06.117
- This book is thick. - Thank you.

00:57:07.247 --> 00:57:09.287
Hey, no crying now.

00:57:12.687 --> 00:57:14.287
So, Candidate Kim, you're in charge...

00:57:14.287 --> 00:57:15.887
- of the Hujin Arcade. - Sure.

00:57:15.957 --> 00:57:18.357
Jangsuk-dong, Old and new downtown,

00:57:18.357 --> 00:57:20.057
and we'll all start together.

00:57:20.127 --> 00:57:22.697
- Let's do it. - Alright, one last "Fighting!"

00:57:22.767 --> 00:57:25.437
We got this!

00:57:29.907 --> 00:57:30.977

I have one condition.

for election fraud, abuse of authority, and bribery.

Hey! What do you think you're doing?

Wait, there's a misunderstanding... Hey, you! Call my lawyer!

- Get him. - No, wait! Why?

00:59:08.207 --> 00:59:09.337
You have the right to remain silent.

00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:11.937
What you say may be used against you.

00:59:12.207 --> 00:59:13.807

Hey! Call my lawyer...

00:59:16.677 --> 00:59:19.317
Call Attorney Park! Hey, wait! Just a minute!

Let him make a call. Just one. Come on, just one phone call.

00:59:30.827 --> 00:59:31.827
Good work.

00:59:32.297 --> 00:59:33.697
You've worked so hard for this.

It's for you, Ye On.

01:00:28.147 --> 01:00:29.987
- It's delicious! - It is?

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:33.087
Yeah. There's nothing else like it.

01:00:33.457 --> 01:00:35.757
- Like where? - I don't know.

01:00:36.957 --> 01:00:39.297
That's just what our grandma says every time she eats it.

01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:44.537
It's not just because I work here. This fried chicken is the real deal.

Here, the last piece is for you, Ye On.

01:00:53.177 --> 01:00:56.447
How is it? It's still crispy, right?

Yes.

That was a pretty big event we just had.

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:09.557
Too bad you dropped out of the race. Honestly, instead of a councilman,

01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:11.327
being a chicken restaurant owner suits you better.

01:01:11.957 --> 01:01:14.867
- I agree. - So do I.

01:01:17.367 --> 01:01:21.637

It's all thanks to you two.

Hey, I told you.

01:01:30.347 --> 01:01:33.677
You have a lot of power now. He knelt down for your vote.

01:01:34.547 --> 01:01:35.687
I got chills.

01:01:36.017 --> 01:01:37.457
Maybe he's right?

01:01:39.017 --> 01:01:42.157
In any case, my first time voting was a success.

01:01:42.527 --> 01:01:44.497

Who is everyone?

Wow, you're a great artist. Thank you, Ye On.

You won me a claw game prize and stopped guys who bothered Si On...

Hey, now, Ye On. Remember I quit playing those games?

01:02:17.197 --> 01:02:20.097
Hey, wait a minute. Ye On, is this supposed to be my beard?

01:02:23.497 --> 01:02:26.067
All right, kids. Let's go out and congratulate him.

Ahead of the recent local elections,

a city councilman implicated in corruption scandals was arrested,

01:02:34.907 --> 01:02:36.947
Those involved are being questioned.

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:39.777
He was a 3-term Maheon councilman.

01:02:39.847 --> 01:02:42.417
Choi Woong Sik was seen as a shoo-in for a fourth term.

Do something, Dad.

01:02:44.487 --> 01:02:46.317
- Come on. - Hurry up!

01:02:46.417 --> 01:02:50.527
He has been indicted by prosecutors on seven charges so far.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.927
With other councilmen implicated, businessmen and prosecutors...

01:02:56.997 --> 01:03:01.467
and school staff who covered up his son's violence are summoned.

01:03:01.807 --> 01:03:04.507
The son, Choi Yong Min, also faces attempted murder,

01:03:04.507 --> 01:03:06.407

Good grief. The father and son, getting their due.

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:13.417
It's a waste of food to even feed those scum in prison.

01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:14.947
Isn't that right?

01:03:15.247 --> 01:03:16.347
I'm heading out.

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:19.257
Oh, so soon? Take a carton of milk with you.

01:03:19.817 --> 01:03:23.257
That's okay. I just stopped by to watch the news.

01:03:23.457 --> 01:03:24.597
