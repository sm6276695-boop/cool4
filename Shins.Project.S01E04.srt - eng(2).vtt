(Episode 4)

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.104
Come on. Got it.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:13.704
I almost had it.

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:22.754
All right, this is it.

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:25.984
Come on! Get in there, darn it!

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:29.924
This thing already ate ten bucks. Shouldn't I get at least one?

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:33.664
- How haven't I gotten a single one? - I've won over ten of them.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.294
- How many? - Ten.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.264
- You did? How? - Because I'm good at it.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:44.374
No, I mean, how did you win so many? How did you get that many?

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:47.744
Want me to show you the trick?

00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:51.644
- Yes, show me. - What's in it for me?

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:55.114
Win one first, then we'll talk. That's how you negotiate.

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:56.254
Negotiation?

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:59.784
- What's negotiation? - Negotiation?

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.094
It's when you and I...

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:07.124
both give something to get something we want.

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:09.334
Put the money in.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.704
(Ttoli Super)

00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:17.604
Hey, if you can't win one, I'm getting my money back.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.904
- Okay. - Good.

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.314
- Okay, try it. - Watch.

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:26.184
- Okay. - First, pick the prize you want.

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:28.444
That one! I want that yellow chick.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.984
- Don't pick a toy that's too heavy. - Why?

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.254
Because you're not good enough to win it yet.

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:37.454
- Fine, just do it. - The claw has three prongs, right?

00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:38.694
- Yes. - Use two to grab the neck...

00:02:38.694 --> 00:02:39.994
on each side.

00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:41.694
And the last prong grabs the middle...

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.034
- of its head like this. - Okay.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:45.934
Grab the head on big-headed prizes.

00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:47.934
I got it!

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:50.834
You're amazing! High-five!

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:56.744
Hey.

00:02:57.074 --> 00:02:58.144
What's with you?

00:02:58.214 --> 00:03:01.814
I'd like a slime, please. I held up my end of our deal,

00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:05.584
- so now it's your turn, mister. - Fine. Let's go to the store.

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.394
All right, kiddo. Here's your slime.

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:13.594
- Here you go. - That's right.

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:15.464
This is how you negotiate.

00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:19.734
- Negotiation over! - Okay.

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:20.834
Off you go.

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.934
- Mister. - What?

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:28.474
Next time, If you can't win with five dollars, give up.

00:03:28.844 --> 00:03:32.384
Spending ten bucks on a claw machine is a bit much.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.514
Hey, for that two-dollar slime,

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:40.654
you taught me your secret technique. I think I got the better deal.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.354
You can find that on the internet, you know.

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:47.194
I told my dad how to do it, but he still hasn't won one.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:50.634
He's just not a natural like me. See you.

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:53.904
Unbelievable.

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:10.214
(Shin's Project)

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:18.694
I forgot it.

(Chicken Center)

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:26.634
You're the one who always said...

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:31.534
it's better to use an opponent than make them your enemy.

00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:33.644
Is that what you did this time?

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.374
Lee Sang Hyun and his mother were caught...

00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:39.444
on CCTV at the airport.

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:41.584
You used me to cut off cell service...

00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:43.084
and secured their escape route, didn't you?

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.624
While smuggling Lee Sang Hyun out, you tricked all the authorities.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:46.884
Harbouring a fugitive.

00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:49.094
Aiding and abetting an escape.

00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:53.064
Up to three years in prison or a five-thousand-dollar fine.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:10.774
And I thought we were on the same side.

00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:14.284
Hurry up. We're almost out of time for a ride.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.254
Hey!

00:05:59.764 --> 00:06:03.264
I told you to just go for it! Treat corners like a straight line.

00:06:05.494 --> 00:06:06.704
Relax your forearms.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:12.504
Look. Your traps are way too tense.

00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:15.444
Don't grip so tight. Easy does it.

00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:17.474
Relax. Gently.

00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:24.384
Even my grandma could ride better. How did you even get your license?

00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:27.754
It's harder to focus when you keep nagging me.

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:28.824
Says you!

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:31.054
You were nagging me earlier when I was doing my workbook

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:34.224
- "Says you"? I'm your tutor. - Well, right now, I'm your teacher.

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:39.064
I'll stop nagging. Just do one lap around the course by yourself.

00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:10.064
- Mr. Shin! - Hey, Ye On. Don't run.

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:14.464
Hey, Ye On. I won you a prize at the claw game.

00:07:15.974 --> 00:07:18.474
- You really won this? - Of course I did.

00:07:18.534 --> 00:07:21.604
How many tries did it take? Once? Five times?

00:07:21.904 --> 00:07:22.914
Ten?

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:26.484
What does it matter how many tries? The point is, I won it for you.

00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:30.514
It's only a jackpot on the first go. Otherwise, it's a waste of money.

00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:31.814
Funny.

00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:36.324
You sound just like your sister, Si On.

00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:40.124
That's what my sister says. That's why she won't let me play.

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:43.664
Ye On.

00:07:44.394 --> 00:07:46.364
This has to be our secret from Si On.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.404
I totally wasted my money winning this.

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:54.804
So you have to keep what I said a secret from her too, okay?

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:55.874
Sure.

00:07:59.984 --> 00:08:03.614
- Good grief. - So, what should we name it?

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:04.884
A name?

00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:11.624
You were fine getting them put in. Why fuss now they're coming out?

00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:14.594
- Not there, my foot! - My bad.

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:16.194
You should've said so.

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:19.804
I heard you got hurt at your job. Isn't your boss covering the bills?

00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:22.734
Forget it. It's too embarrassing.

00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:27.204
(Hujin Arcade)

00:08:32.214 --> 00:08:33.644
Lee Sang Hyun and his mother were caught...

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:36.014
on CCTV at the airport.

00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:39.954
What did it do wrong?

00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:42.694
What?

00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:46.524
What did that table do to deserve being tortured with a rag like that?

00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:50.534
That's not it, sir.

00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:55.104
You've barely started working here and you're already slacking off?

00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:57.374
It's not that, sir. It's just that you...

00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:01.574
- kept things from me. - What did I ever do to you?

00:09:02.204 --> 00:09:05.474
- You're secretly breaking laws. - I'm doing what?

00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:07.684
Never mind.

00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:12.014
Such a slacker.

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:15.794
Hello. I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:18.024
Hey, he's not a customer.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.224
He's not?

00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:21.764
Business must be booming. You even hired help.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.994
He's not my help. He was left here.

00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:25.234
Step outside for a bit.

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:26.604
- What? - I said, get over here.

00:09:26.664 --> 00:09:29.804
Why tell me to leave now? You don't give orders in my kitchen.

00:09:29.874 --> 00:09:33.074
Technically, it's my kitchen. I didn't even charge you a deposit.

00:09:33.144 --> 00:09:36.014
Well, if you're on a power trip, you might as well waive my rent too.

00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:37.644
You change the oil every day, right?

00:09:37.714 --> 00:09:40.244
- Can't you tell just by looking? - Of course I can.

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:41.314
As if you know...

00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:44.014
So, where's the sweet rice flour?

00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:53.394
Why would you look for it there? It's right here.

00:09:53.624 --> 00:09:54.794
(Sweet Rice Flour)

00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:01.734
Actually, I was about to buy some.

00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:03.074
Hey, Pillip.

00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:06.474
- You were about to get this, right? - What?

00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:07.604
The sweet rice flour.

00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:12.944
Right.

00:10:13.944 --> 00:10:15.544
You're not just phoning it in, are you?

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.814
Who, me?

00:10:17.114 --> 00:10:20.824
I put my all into this business.

00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:23.194
Hey, Pillip. Back me up here.

00:10:23.794 --> 00:10:24.824
About what?

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.364
My dedication.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:32.164
Right. Our chicken is really delicious.

00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:40.474
Hey.

00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:43.044
Go buy the sweet rice flour.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.414
I'll go get it.

00:10:50.354 --> 00:10:51.354
Hurry back.

00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:54.324
Well, your apprentice is dense.

00:10:54.424 --> 00:10:58.294
He's not my hire. I'm stuck with him. He'll quit soon enough.

00:10:58.354 --> 00:11:01.194
You think I'd hire someone that dense?

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:03.634
But I mean I like him because he's a terrible liar.

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.794
Sounds like he's exactly the kind of person you need.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.834
These old guys...

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:12.944
They're all the same, always barging into my shop unannounced.

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:17.514
Judge Kim was here too? Then who else put that kid here?

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:21.284
Darn, I'm a step too late. I should've put my own guy in here.

00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:24.254
What am I, a dartboard? What's this "putting people in" talk?

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:27.954
This darn chicken shop...

00:11:28.524 --> 00:11:30.724
(So glad you're here.)

00:11:30.794 --> 00:11:32.094
I've seen him somewhere before.

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:35.294
(Park Myeong Jin)

00:11:35.364 --> 00:11:36.694
(Businessman)

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:37.964
That's him.

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:40.704
Let's see. Thousands, millions, billions...

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.374
Twenty-seven billion?

00:11:43.634 --> 00:11:46.104
Wait, why would a corporate chairman be at our chicken place?

00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:48.404
Who in the world is Mr. Shin?

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:51.644
Mr. Shin? He's the real deal.

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:54.214
The guy's connections are insane.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:59.584
He's a negotiation expert who the government fought hard to get.

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:02.484
But if he's such a big shot, why is nothing about him online?

00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:04.424
What's the deal with this chicken shop?

00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:07.694
If you're so curious, find out for yourself.

00:12:10.634 --> 00:12:12.904
(So glad you're here.)

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.134
Now what?

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:19.644
That guy's the landlord, right?

00:12:22.104 --> 00:12:23.874
Is he here about the commercial redevelopment?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.444
Yes, so he says.

00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:28.314
Anyway, where are you off to, all dressed up?

00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:30.914
I'm visiting my ancestors' grave.

00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:32.654
So what did the landlord say?

00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:34.624
Did he say you could keep the chicken shop running?

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.694
Who knows. What about you?

00:12:38.594 --> 00:12:41.924
That's what's been keeping me up. I'm worried I'll be forced out.

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.034
Why? Are you planning to retire?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.164
Retire? No, I'm perfectly able-bodied.

00:12:47.504 --> 00:12:49.334
I can still thread a needle without glasses.

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:53.544
Well then, just keep at it. What's the problem?

00:12:53.644 --> 00:12:57.374
That's the problem. My landlord, Mr. Kim,

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:01.084
- says there's no space for my shop. - What?

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.084
Who gets to decide that?

00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:04.654
Beats me.

00:13:05.314 --> 00:13:08.954
I did all I could to please him. I ironed his shirts for free.

00:13:09.024 --> 00:13:11.754
I even took care of his wife's mink coat.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.624
And then he just stabbed me in the back.

00:13:13.764 --> 00:13:17.394
So what, you're going to go ask your ancestors for help?

00:13:17.694 --> 00:13:18.694
No.

00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:21.804
I have something different to tell them today.

00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:24.934
I'm just going to pay my respects and make a fresh start.

00:13:25.574 --> 00:13:28.674
A fresh start? At your age?

00:13:29.004 --> 00:13:30.944
Let's just say I have a plan.

00:13:31.414 --> 00:13:32.614
Hey, no.

00:13:33.084 --> 00:13:35.484
You can't open that yet. It's important.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.724
I'm back.

00:13:42.894 --> 00:13:45.254
- Hello, sir. - Hello, there.

00:13:47.964 --> 00:13:50.764
So what's the word from Pluto? Did he meet with the landlord?

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.464
As for Mr. Jang, the landlord...

00:13:53.534 --> 00:13:56.774
Whatever, I don't even want to know. I'm off.

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:58.834
Hey, at least have a cup of coffee before you go.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.944
He's dying to know, but he pretends not to.

00:14:11.514 --> 00:14:13.154
Hey, Pillip.

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:15.254
Let's go grab some lunch.

00:14:16.094 --> 00:14:17.724
But it's not even eleven yet.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.564
Hey, just meet me at Pluto.

00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:23.564
- Another order of meatballs! - Got it.

00:14:23.564 --> 00:14:25.364
- Hey, Si On. Have you had lunch? - Meatballs, got it.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:26.764
Not yet.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:29.364
- Making a delivery? - Yes.

00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:30.974
Be safe.

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:34.844
- Enjoy your lunch. - You too. Be careful out there.

00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:39.814
My sister had to get stitches in her arm.

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:44.784
- And a big bruise on her stomach. - So how did she get hurt?

00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:46.724
She said she fell off her scooter.

00:14:47.724 --> 00:14:49.754
- That's a lie. - A lie?

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:51.554
There wasn't a scratch on her scooter.

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:54.624
Someone must have hurt her.

00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:57.334
You have to find whoever did it and teach them a lesson.

00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:03.004
I will.

00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:05.474
I'll teach them a lesson. I promise.

00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:09.714
Here, have this to start. It's on the house.

00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:11.644
- Thank you. - Hey, Mr. Jang.

00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:13.814
Do you ever get nightmare customers?

00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:18.314
We had this guy appear on a livestream, looking all smug,

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.324
Si On got chewed out on a delivery because of it. It was a mess.

00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:23.124
What? I wasn't trying to show off.

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:26.724
You're the one who sent me there. I was just caught on camera.

00:15:26.794 --> 00:15:27.794
Hey.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:30.794
I told you to make a delivery, not to star in a show.

00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:34.004
You were flaunting your looks in that suit,

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:36.874
and Si On ended up taking the heat for it. That's a fact.

00:15:36.974 --> 00:15:38.174
Don't even get me started.

00:15:38.474 --> 00:15:42.604
Just the other day, some jerk called and said that the food was soggy,

00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:43.914
so I checked his order and he'd gotten...

00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:46.144
fried rice and sweet and sour pork.

00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:49.754
I even packed his sauces separately,

00:15:49.814 --> 00:15:51.414
so I asked him how anything could be soggy.

00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:55.954
He said the driver was rude and that it ruined the taste of the food.

00:15:56.294 --> 00:15:58.194
Does that even make any sense?

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:00.624
So what happened?

00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:03.794
He threatened to file a complaint,

00:16:03.794 --> 00:16:05.034
but then he ordered again today.

00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:06.804
Wait, is that where she just went for a delivery?

00:16:07.104 --> 00:16:08.104
(Elevator under Maintenance)

00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:11.034
(Repairs in Progress)

00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:14.204
Yong Pal, that son of a witch.

00:16:18.374 --> 00:16:19.914
But I have to make the delivery.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:43.634
You jerk.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.544
You're late.

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:48.944
The elevator's out.

00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:50.244
Did you have to take the stairs?

00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:57.584
Apparently, he was a lawyer before he started working for me.

00:16:59.384 --> 00:17:00.654
A real lawyer?

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:02.224
Yes.

00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:05.654
Then why are you working at a chicken restaurant?

00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:06.894
It's a long story.

00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:10.564
Hey now, Mr. Jang. You have a funny way with words.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:12.064
What's wrong with a chicken restaurant?

00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:13.764
It's not about the chicken restaurant.

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:16.164
A lawyer in a place like this is odd.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.104
Just a moment.

00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:24.814
Hello, this is Pluto.

00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:31.084
- Excuse me? - I said the noodles are stuck.

00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:35.184
The sweet and sour pork is also soggy. How can I eat this? Darn it.

00:17:35.324 --> 00:17:36.524
I told her...

00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:40.024
to bring me a new order, but she's refusing.

00:17:40.264 --> 00:17:42.064
How do you train your employees? Darn it.

00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:44.734
Hey.

00:17:46.904 --> 00:17:47.904
Hey!

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:51.704
Take it.

00:17:58.214 --> 00:17:59.214
Yes?

00:17:59.574 --> 00:18:00.744
Just give him a refund, please.

00:18:01.984 --> 00:18:02.984
Okay.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:15.194
You've got to be kidding me. I'm starving, and you bring garbage,

00:18:15.264 --> 00:18:16.264
and all I get is a refund?

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.534
Hey, you should be compensating me for damages!

00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:23.774
You don't need a fancy degree to know that's just common sense.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:26.944
Is this how you use your education?

00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:29.844
You purposely made me take the stairs.

00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:32.544
You're getting a refund, so just order from somewhere else.

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:35.484
I won't charge you for the broth. Go mix rice in it or whatever.

00:18:36.144 --> 00:18:37.984
Where do you think you're going? Clean up this mess.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.954
You son of a...

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.224
Still hurts?

00:18:46.864 --> 00:18:48.664
Why did you run off and get hurt?

00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:51.394
I wanted to meet up with a classmate.

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:56.034
You spilt it, you clean it up.

00:18:56.634 --> 00:18:58.234
And make sure you sort your recycling properly.

00:18:58.574 --> 00:18:59.574
What a creep.

00:19:01.704 --> 00:19:04.444
Crazy witch. Hey, delivery girl! Lee Si On!

00:19:05.974 --> 00:19:08.284
Darn it. You're dead meat.

00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:09.854
Lee Si On! Darn it.

If a customer uses insulting names like "jerk" or "son of a witch,"

00:19:16.084 --> 00:19:17.794
for public insult, under Article 311 of the Criminal Act,

or a fine of up to two thousand dollars.

Anyway, if that jerk of a customer gives Si On any trouble,

00:19:26.094 --> 00:19:28.904
- Give me a call right away. - Will do.

00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:32.704
And not a word of this to Si On.

00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:35.774
- Right. - I'll do whatever I can to help.

00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:38.074

Look, with a high-ranking job, you're too busy pleasing bosses...

and do anything but bust fellow cops. It's not for me.

So please, cut me some slack.

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:05.334
I should be saying that to you.

Don't feel awkward because I'm older.

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:45.254
- You are off the route. - Where are you going?

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:49.594
This isn't the right way.

00:23:49.894 --> 00:23:50.894
This isn't the GPS route.

00:23:51.194 --> 00:23:52.394
We should've turned left back there.

00:23:56.404 --> 00:23:58.404
You are off the route.

00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:00.174
(Five minutes remaining)

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:03.574
You shaved off 5 minutes.

00:24:04.174 --> 00:24:05.174
See that?

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.684
That's what you call skill.

00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:12.484
Just go. You obviously don't need a GPS.

00:24:14.024 --> 00:24:16.254
- Alright, we're heading out. - Drive safe!

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:21.294
They're a weirdly good match.

00:24:22.024 --> 00:24:24.034
Then again, I think she could do better.

00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:45.984
- Mom. - Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

00:24:46.054 --> 00:24:47.054
Mom.

00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:48.724
- Don't cry. Look at me, okay? - Mommy...

00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:51.424
- Mommy. - I'm getting you out. It's okay.

00:24:51.494 --> 00:24:53.524
What do you mean, 'it's okay'? What about me?

00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:55.924
I'm not crazy!

00:24:59.734 --> 00:25:02.234
It's also weird that the CCTV was off.

00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:06.004
Han Ji Yeong and Lee Han Jun were murdered.

00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:09.844
Yun Dong Hee is faking being on drugs. Can't you tell?

00:25:10.714 --> 00:25:11.744
Gosh.

00:25:12.674 --> 00:25:13.884
Seriously!

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.464
(Chicken Center)

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:34.064
Welcome.

00:25:35.404 --> 00:25:36.604
Just one?

00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:39.174
- Yes. - Sit anywhere you like.

00:25:53.724 --> 00:25:55.424
So, what can I get for you?

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:59.354
- Fried chicken and a Coke, please. - You got it.

00:26:05.434 --> 00:26:06.434
Nice.

00:26:07.164 --> 00:26:09.134
I beat the GPS by seven minutes.

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:10.534
Gosh.

00:26:11.404 --> 00:26:12.574
It's pure skill.

00:26:17.414 --> 00:26:18.414
That'll be 20 dollars.

00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:23.584
I'll go get my wallet, so just wait by the door.

00:26:23.784 --> 00:26:25.014
Oh, I'll just wait outside.

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:26.884
Okay, then.

00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:33.894
- You again? - What about you? Delivering again?

00:26:34.464 --> 00:26:36.964
I see you running several deliveries from dawn till dusk.

00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:39.634
You're nuts. Now pay me for the chicken.

00:26:43.504 --> 00:26:44.504
Before I do...

00:26:45.004 --> 00:26:46.944
That mess you made in the hallway of my officetel.

00:26:47.674 --> 00:26:48.674
You need to pay for the clean up.

00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:53.074
You're the one who made the mess. How dare you ask me to pay for it?

00:26:53.884 --> 00:26:56.954
- Gosh! - I've let it slide, witch! Darn it.

00:26:58.454 --> 00:26:59.954
You haven't changed a bit since high school.

00:27:00.854 --> 00:27:02.654
When are you going to grow up?

00:27:05.754 --> 00:27:07.124
Hey! You're not getting away! Let go!

00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:08.964
Hey, stop moving!

00:27:12.194 --> 00:27:13.194
Look at her!

00:27:18.474 --> 00:27:20.504
You witch. You were too poor to even graduate.

00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:23.344
I'm giving you business out of pity, and this is how you treat customers?

00:27:24.374 --> 00:27:25.844
How about your damages cover the fee?

00:27:27.044 --> 00:27:28.344
Oh, really?

00:27:32.654 --> 00:27:33.784
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:36.584 --> 00:27:37.594
Lee Si On.

00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:39.324
Are you okay?

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:43.834
Who on earth are you, you jerk?

00:27:48.164 --> 00:27:49.864
Gosh, you jerk!

00:27:50.404 --> 00:27:52.774
Darn it! Seriously!

00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:55.104
Let's go.

00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:02.184
I told you, I'm fine.

00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:08.954
I mean,

00:28:09.284 --> 00:28:10.924
can you even ride this thing? Want me to do it?

00:28:11.924 --> 00:28:13.294
I'm perfectly fine, I said.

00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:15.864
You're usually so useless.

00:28:16.624 --> 00:28:17.694
So, what was all that back there?

00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:20.604
What are you talking about? When have I ever been useless?

00:28:20.704 --> 00:28:22.004
I graduated from the Police University.

00:28:22.264 --> 00:28:23.734
I'm a 3rd Dan in Taekwondo and a 2nd Dan in Geomdo.

00:28:23.804 --> 00:28:24.804
There you go, bragging again.

00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:26.074
Gosh.

00:28:28.004 --> 00:28:29.004
Oh, right.

00:28:29.904 --> 00:28:31.144
The money for the fried chicken.

00:28:33.174 --> 00:28:34.514
That scumbag. Unbelievable.

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:38.014
Ever since high school,

00:28:38.614 --> 00:28:39.784
has he been bullying you like that?

00:28:41.184 --> 00:28:42.754
What are you looking at?

00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:45.494
Hey. From now on, you're my cigarette runner.

00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:46.754
I don't have any money.

00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:48.064
You don't have what?

00:28:50.964 --> 00:28:53.164
Hey. Is this the jerk?

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.334
Hey!

00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:57.574
I said, stay still!

00:28:58.104 --> 00:28:59.634
Hey! Get your head down.

00:29:00.304 --> 00:29:01.444
Gosh, seriously.

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:05.744
Is that why...

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.184
I didn't drop out of school because of him.

00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:16.084
You go on ahead. I'll grab a cab.

00:29:17.024 --> 00:29:18.494
Wait, you're not going back there, are you?

00:29:19.024 --> 00:29:21.164
Choi Yong Pal is a total thug and a complete psycho.

00:29:21.664 --> 00:29:24.664
- He's trouble, so stay out of it. - It's fine.

00:29:25.394 --> 00:29:28.334
- He's got a bigger problem with me. - But...

00:29:28.404 --> 00:29:29.434
Don't worry.

00:29:30.134 --> 00:29:31.134
I won't be reckless.

00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:33.904
I'll just get the chicken money and be right back.

00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:40.114
All right, I'm heading out.

00:29:41.684 --> 00:29:43.444
- Don't take too long. - Okay.

00:29:43.954 --> 00:29:44.954
Gosh.

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:54.424
Get home safe.

00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:56.194
Hurry back.

00:30:04.934 --> 00:30:06.034
There we go.

00:30:07.174 --> 00:30:08.174
Looks delicious, doesn't it?

00:30:08.574 --> 00:30:11.514
- It does. - So, do you live around here?

00:30:11.844 --> 00:30:13.984
- No. - First time here?

00:30:14.584 --> 00:30:15.584
It is.

00:30:17.484 --> 00:30:18.484
Oh, never mind.

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.924
Well, let me know if you need anything.

00:30:23.524 --> 00:30:26.694
- Mr. Shin! - What? Si On, you've no deliveries.

00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:29.294
Hey, why are you here alone? Where's Pillip?

00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.504
Choi Yong Pal is a total thug and a complete psycho.

00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:45.944
He's trouble, so stay out of it.

00:30:48.614 --> 00:30:49.614
Forget it.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.000
Come on, why isn't he answering his phone?

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.370
- Where are you going? - I'll go check on him.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440
No, don't!

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.610
Hey, wait, Si On!

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.880
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.950
Something urgent has just come up,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.320
I'm afraid I have to close now. Can I pack this up for you?

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.690
- Please do. - Oh, thank you so much.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.770
(Mr. Shin)

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.080
- Yes, Mr. Shin. - Si On, where are you right now?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.380
I'm following a suspicious car.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.580
Don't do anything until I get there. Got it?

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.250
Just hurry up and get here.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.630
(Si on)

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440
Hey!

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.780
Someone's in here!

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.780
Hello?

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.350
Is anyone in there?

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.820
Someone's in here!

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.840
Si On!

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.440
What about the car? Where is it?

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:46.610
(Junkyard)

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.920
It's ringing, but he's not picking up.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.530
- Right. - Si On, go check over there.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.590
Okay.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.010
Someone's in here!

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.290
- Someone's in here! - Hey, Cho Pillip!

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.000
- Pillip! - Cho Pillip!

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.360
Pillip!

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.230
Pillip!

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.270
(Lowering)

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.350
- Pillip! - Answer us!

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:00.650
Cho Pillip!

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.280
Someone's in here!

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.880
I said, I'm in here!

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520
Pillip!

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.050
Cho Pillip!

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.290
- Mr. Shin! - Where are you?

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.560
- Mister, over there! - Pillip! Where?

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:58.410
Stop!

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.340
Pillip!

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:01.810
- Pillip! - Raise it! Hurry!

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.910
- Raise it now! Lift it! - Lift it! Hurry up!

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.780
- What are you doing? Lift it up! - Raise it!

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.980
Please, lift it up!

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.790
Hey, Pillip! Get him out of there, quick!

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.250
Hey! Grab him!

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:15.420
Easy!

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.890
You got him? Two, three.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.190
Easy.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.460
- Cut this for me. - Okay.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.970
Man, what on earth?

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.200
Hey, Pillip, you okay?

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.010
- Can you move at all? - I think so...

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.140
- I'm okay. Just help me up. - All right.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.210
Let me.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.550
Hey, Si On. Take him to the hospital. Go ahead.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.390
- Okay. - All right, you. Let's have a talk.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.820
- Where's your office? - Right this way.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.120
Go on, hurry.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.630
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.330
I've got a bump on my head. I think they knocked me out.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.870
Hold on.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.390
I may be a bad driver,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.290
but I know a thing or two about cars.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.030
There's an emergency release inside the trunk.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.060
You're annoying.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.800
- Hey, I was just at death's door. - You got a death wish?

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.570
I told you Yong Pal is a psycho. I said to stay away. Why did you go?

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.340
You have no idea how ruthless that guy is.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.840
Sorry for making you worry.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.480
You should find another line of work.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.880
You're not cut out for delivery work.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.020
Where are you going? Wait up.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.350
Hey.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.490
I mean...

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.130
I just thought you'd be worried, so...

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.000
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.380
Because of me...

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.890
You almost died because of me!

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.440
I'm sorry I joked about it.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.740
And thanks for worrying about me.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.450
(Under CCTV Surveillance)

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.890
Why isn't this working?

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.060
What do you mean it isn't working? When you have this sign posted?

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.490
I just found out myself, but...

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.060
- Alab, did you turn off the CCTV? - No, it wasn't me.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.070
So it was working at some point. What about the other employees?

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.000
They all went home after the company dinner.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.870
Then why were you two still here?

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.640
Alab and I came back after dinner for a steel mill shipment tomorrow.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.580
Do you have team dinners often?

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.350
Just every now and then.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.320
Today, our boss booked a BBQ place, so it was just the employees.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:05.950
Just the employees?

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.550
Yes.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.990
Sounds like a good boss.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.690
This is nice.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600
What?

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.670
Gosh.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.370
Hey, what's up? For the record, you called me.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.910
- Kim pro, dig dirt on someone. - On who?

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.980
As much as you can, as fast as you can.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.540
Yes.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.180
So, what'd they say?

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.780
They said he's fine.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.750
No concussion, and the bump will go down soon.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.450
I told them I was fine, but they insisted on a CT scan.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.590
Right. You get hit on the back of the head and knocked out,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:44.060
and almost crushed in a compactor, but I'm glad to hear you're "fine."

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.300
Gosh. No evidence, no doctor's report...

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.770
- How am I supposed to fight this? - This is all my fault.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.970
How is this your fault? Yong Pal is the one to blame.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.740
Should we file a police report?

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.140
I just told you. We have no evidence!

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.410
I'm going to handle this myself. I will take care of it.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.250
As your boss, there's no way I can let this slide.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.620
The nerve of those punks. How dare they mess with my staff?

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.590
My way.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.190
I'll deal with this personally.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.260
Then what about me?

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.260
You just rest up.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.170
Then I'll look for evidence my own way.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.880
My apartment building doesn't have any CCTV.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.510
But there's a camera right here.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:39.350
That one's a fake. It's a dummy.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.650
A fake.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.990
(Multi-purpose CCTV in operation)

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.910
Excuse me, could I please check this security camera?

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.110
I was assaulted near here, but I don't have any evidence.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.350
I'll check the camera with this number.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.550
Officer Lee, can I get the request form, please?

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.090
Hey, digging into that family is actually pretty interesting.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.730
- I got everything but a few things. - What? Why'd you leave those out?

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:32.670
It's my lunch break. We public servants must eat on time.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.040
Oh, I know. Even when I was at death's door,

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.400
you were having your meal all by yourself, right on time.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.540
Stop messing around. I'm hanging up.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.610
Just send it already.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.510
(Chicken Center)

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.890
(Closed today)

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.260
So, Mr. Shin, is "your way" working out for you?

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.530
How about you?

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.640
I'm working hard too. Even at the law firm, meeting people...

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.870
was pretty much all on me.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240
Is that right?

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.270
By the way, Mr. Shin, how did you know?

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.580
- Know what? - That Choi Yong Min was after her.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.450
How would I have known that? I had no idea who Choi Yong Min was.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.290
That can't be right. You said to be her secret bodyguard.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.590
That's why I followed her deliveries and put a tracker on your phone.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.260
That was just because Mr. Jang from Pluto...

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.100
mentioned a problem customer, so I was just being cautious.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.270
Thanks to that, we protected Si On and I saved you too.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.940
A little "better safe than sorry" killed two birds with one stone.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.440
Jackpot, in one word.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.970
Just rest up.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:46.840
Where are you going? Want me to come?

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.180
No, it's our official day off. You should just rest.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:51.710
I'll be back.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.390
(Chicken Center)

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.910
- Who is it? - Delivery.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.480
I didn't order anything.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.120
- It's a delivery. - Darn it.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.090
Darn it, I said I didn't order anything.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.660
Isn't this unit 1208?

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.960
That jerk. Did he really order it to the wrong address?

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.460
With an attitude like that, you must be Yong Pal.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.430
Who are you?

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.800
You a cop?

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:51.070
Hey. Scum like you ruin our scrap,

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.370
and our country's steel industry pays the price.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.480
You jerk. Did you try crushing my guy in a car?

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.310
- Did you order the car crushed? - What? I did nothing.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.750
- You got proof? - Proof?

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.380
Proof?

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.790
Proof...

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:09.060
Right here, you jerk.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.260
Hey!

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.430
Yes, I recorded his voice. Sending it now.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.670
(Adding voice)

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.710
(Cloning Voice)

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.310
(Voice Generation Complete)

00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:48.991
It's been a while.

00:45:49.521 --> 00:45:50.591
Mr. Shin.

00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:54.091
I wanted to thank you for your help the other day.

00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:57.461
I was in a real jam,

00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:00.401
and you were the only one who came to mind.

00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:02.201
I'm glad you called.

00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:06.671
I was just happy I could help.

00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:10.741
I bet Ji Woo's all grown up.

00:46:11.711 --> 00:46:12.781
Is she doing well?

00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:16.251
She's in college already.

00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:18.421
I just saw her last month.

00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.851
- She's doing great. - Good.

00:46:23.121 --> 00:46:24.351
By the way, Madam Joo.

00:46:25.121 --> 00:46:26.921
Do you have any old photos of Ji Woo,

00:46:27.761 --> 00:46:31.861
like one of her in a white dress holding a doll?

00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:41.841
You mean this one?

00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:48.681
I'm sorry, sir. Something urgent has come up.

00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:53.781
I saw a man with this photo yesterday.

00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:58.791
Where? What did he look like?

00:46:59.391 --> 00:47:02.631
He came by my restaurant.

00:47:11.601 --> 00:47:12.641
Kim Yong Woo.

00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:18.881
- The Kim Yong Woo from back then? - Yes.

00:47:20.081 --> 00:47:21.551
That's him. That scum.

00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:23.111
Ji Woo's father.

00:47:53.481 --> 00:47:55.211
Having a hard time focusing today?

00:47:58.751 --> 00:47:59.951
It's just...

00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:04.221
I'm just wondering what the point of all this is.

00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:06.591
Why did you want to do it in the first place?

00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:08.831
Well...

00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:12.801
So I wouldn't get disrespected by jerks like Yong Pal.

00:48:14.461 --> 00:48:16.201
What good is a GED anyway?

00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:19.141
Even a genius like you almost got killed.

00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:21.641
All the more reason to fight hard to make sure he's punished.

00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:24.441
That guy, Yong Pal...

00:48:26.511 --> 00:48:28.481
Has he been harassing you all this time?

00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:32.651
For about...

00:48:33.321 --> 00:48:34.381
a month now?

00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:36.851
I ran into him on a delivery.

00:49:01.081 --> 00:49:02.681
He's still the same old jerk,

00:49:03.451 --> 00:49:05.651
but he had the nerve to give me crap about dropping out.

00:49:06.081 --> 00:49:07.381
It was humiliating,

00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:09.791
and it just upset me.

00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:12.291
Whatever your motivation was,

00:49:13.261 --> 00:49:14.261
what matters is that you're doing it.

00:49:15.061 --> 00:49:16.531
But what's going to change even if I do?

00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:18.731
Even if I pass the GED, I'm still...

00:49:20.631 --> 00:49:21.671
I'm...

00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:23.571
just me.

00:49:24.931 --> 00:49:27.501
Still got nothing, still powerless,

00:49:28.201 --> 00:49:32.781
just a burden on you for no reason. And Yong Pal's dad is running again.

00:49:37.951 --> 00:49:39.051
You are powerful.

00:49:41.421 --> 00:49:42.451
Are you kidding me?

00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:44.951
I know you're only helping me because you feel sorry for me.

00:49:46.161 --> 00:49:48.161
No, you really are powerful.

00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:59.741
Look. The preamble to Korea's Constitution.

00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:02.011
The supreme law that defines government...

00:50:02.011 --> 00:50:04.311
and the people's rights and duties.

00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:07.381
No law is above the Constitution. And what's more...

00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:15.121
It's the most powerful law in the country.

00:50:15.351 --> 00:50:17.721
And do you know what the very first article says?

00:50:18.091 --> 00:50:19.191
Article 1, Clause 1.

00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:21.391
The Republic of Korea shall be a democratic republic.

00:50:21.691 --> 00:50:24.831
Clause Two: The sovereignty of the ROK shall reside in the people,

00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:27.601
and all state authority shall emanate from the people.

00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:30.431
You said Yong Pal's dad is a city councilman, right?

00:50:30.931 --> 00:50:32.701
His power comes from the people too.

00:50:32.771 --> 00:50:36.711
- That's just textbook stuff. - Exactly.

00:50:38.141 --> 00:50:39.411
You have the right to vote, don't you?

00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.041
That's your power.

00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:45.181
And Yong Pal's dad desperately needs your vote.

00:50:47.251 --> 00:50:48.821
The local elections are just around the corner.

00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.391
(Article 1: The ROK is a democracy.)

00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:53.621
(Article 2: Korean citizenship is defined by law.)

00:50:58.231 --> 00:50:59.761
You should quit your delivery job and become a judge.

00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:01.531
It suits you better.

00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:06.801
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:09.871
Idiot.

00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:16.351
For that compliment, dinner's on me. I can get a bite before I go, right?

00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:25.161
(Mr. Shin)

00:51:32.931 --> 00:51:36.471
Hey, I thought we were off. You told me to take the day off.

00:51:36.731 --> 00:51:38.271
You've been resting all day.

00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:40.501
What good is that if I haven't even had dinner yet?

00:51:40.571 --> 00:51:42.811
Are you hungry? Want me to fry you some chicken?

00:51:44.071 --> 00:51:45.481
So, why'd you call me in?

00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:49.051
To share what I've got on Yong Pal.

00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:54.481
Though I'm still going to handle it my way.

00:51:55.591 --> 00:51:56.621
Have a seat.

00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.731
By saving Lee Sang Hyun,

00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:12.441
the same way you spirited him out of the country?

00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:22.911
Mr. Shin. You know that's aiding a fugitive?

00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:29.351
Thanks to Lee Sang Hyun, you exposed all that corruption...

00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:32.721
and got the cancer patients justice.

00:52:32.721 --> 00:52:33.721
I get that, but...

00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:35.931
So what? Should I have just let him die?

00:52:36.491 --> 00:52:39.201
And that poor mother would have lost both her kids,

00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:41.361
and spent her life in misery. Is that it?

00:52:42.401 --> 00:52:44.101
Pillip, what would you have done in my shoes?

00:52:49.441 --> 00:52:52.011
- Hey. - Manager Kim.

00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:54.181
What's up? How have you been doing?

00:52:55.111 --> 00:52:56.751
What's up? Real cool entrance?

00:52:57.011 --> 00:52:59.481
- Try showing up on time for once. - I know.

00:53:00.451 --> 00:53:01.821
- Hey, Kim pro. - Yes?

00:53:01.821 --> 00:53:03.891
So, did you dig up all the dirt?

00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:06.721
You know it. Hey, get me some coffee.

00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.721
I'll get it.

00:53:07.721 --> 00:53:10.161
No, it's okay. He's very particular about his coffee.

00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:13.201
- I'll do it. Put the kettle on. - But...

00:53:14.401 --> 00:53:15.871
dig up dirt on who?

00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:25.481
Choi Woong Sik. A three-term city councilman.

00:53:26.681 --> 00:53:31.111
Choi Woong Sik owns that whole area, including the Buhyeong Scrapyard.

00:53:31.181 --> 00:53:34.981
The scrapyard is leased by Chae Eui Soo for next to nothing.

00:53:35.151 --> 00:53:37.291
Chae Eui Soo? What's their connection?

00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:40.361
They're as close as brothers. And their sons are friends too.

00:53:40.961 --> 00:53:44.891
- Choi Woong Sik! - Choi Woong Sik!

00:53:44.961 --> 00:53:48.801
He works the campaign at elections and even heads the fundraising.

00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:51.301
Just hearing about it reeks of corruption.

00:53:51.731 --> 00:53:53.941
He must be getting a lot of kickbacks.

00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:57.841
And get this. In this city, Choi Woong Sik...

00:53:57.911 --> 00:53:59.681
has more pull than the mayor.

00:53:59.711 --> 00:54:03.411
Why just a councilman? He could be a lawmaker or even a governor.

00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:05.651
It's not that he can't, it's that he won't.

00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:08.321
He has all the money and power he needs.

00:54:08.351 --> 00:54:12.561
His son is a total train wreck. He beat up kids in middle school,

00:54:12.621 --> 00:54:16.361
bullying them, and doing other terrible things.

00:54:16.431 --> 00:54:17.491
But there's not one article about it.

00:54:17.531 --> 00:54:20.301
Because his father's above the law?

00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:23.201
That's insane. Covering up school bullying?

00:54:23.201 --> 00:54:26.501
What about the victims? That trauma lasts a lifetime.

00:54:26.571 --> 00:54:28.301
Why are you yelling at me?

00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:31.911
Hey, Pillip. Are you this worked up over Si On?

00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.241
Yes.

00:54:34.781 --> 00:54:35.911
Well, it's partly because of Si On.

00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:38.181
And the other victims too.

00:54:40.421 --> 00:54:42.551
Choi Yong Min's father, Choi Woong Sik.

00:54:43.121 --> 00:54:44.651
Is he running in this election?

00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:47.221
His kick-off ceremony was last week. He's about to win his fourth term.

00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:49.591
- No, that can't happen. - Says who?

00:54:51.591 --> 00:54:56.501
Hey, you two, be careful. Wasn't your assistant nearly crushed?

00:54:56.701 --> 00:55:00.341
There are more people out there who don't value life than you think.

00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:02.111
Don't worry about me.

00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:03.941
I don't die.

00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:08.011
Hey, golden boy. Know my nickname in the Middle East?

00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:13.481
Never Die.

00:55:17.391 --> 00:55:18.891
What about in the US?

00:55:20.061 --> 00:55:21.161
Kim Pro.

00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:24.961
- You telling him stories about me? - No.

00:55:28.701 --> 00:55:29.931
Die Hard.

00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:33.501
Stop laughing.

00:55:38.441 --> 00:55:39.741
Stop laughing.

00:55:42.281 --> 00:55:43.851
And what are you laughing at?

00:55:44.111 --> 00:55:47.851
I just love that movie. My mom is a huge Bruce Willis fan.

00:55:47.921 --> 00:55:51.921
Hey, don't bring up Bruce Willis. The man's retired.

00:55:52.461 --> 00:55:54.661
Oh, gosh. This guy...

00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:57.791
couldn't die even if he wanted to. Right?

00:55:59.861 --> 00:56:01.431
(Mahon's leap forward! Choi Woong Sik)

00:56:05.841 --> 00:56:07.871
(City councilman Choi Woong Sik)

00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:09.541
Please get some tea for our guest.

00:56:10.641 --> 00:56:11.641
Thank you.

00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:13.241
Here you go.

00:56:13.241 --> 00:56:16.081
(Achievement Award)

00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:19.281
- Please, have some tea. - Thank you.

00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:24.521
I know Hujin Arcade well. I've been a local for 40 years.

00:56:24.921 --> 00:56:26.861
Is that right?

00:56:27.321 --> 00:56:29.261
So that must be why everyone...

00:56:29.331 --> 00:56:32.761
kept telling me I had to come and see you.

00:56:33.861 --> 00:56:35.601
Even without this city council pin,

00:56:35.671 --> 00:56:38.471
neighbours should help each other out.

00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:40.301
Yes, of course.

00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:44.271
So, sir, what seems to be the problem?

00:56:45.681 --> 00:56:47.511
I...

00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:51.151
run a business that relies on deliveries.

00:56:51.211 --> 00:56:53.721
And I see all kinds of customers.

00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:59.021
One customer was on a power trip, and it went way too far.

00:56:59.121 --> 00:57:02.021
Are people still that shameless out there?

00:57:02.091 --> 00:57:04.761
Tell me about it. They're out there.

00:57:05.391 --> 00:57:06.501
Councilman.

00:57:06.901 --> 00:57:10.171
My driver had such a hard time with them,

00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:13.471
she started recording their interactions when she could.

00:57:15.511 --> 00:57:17.971
- Would you mind taking a listen? - Of course.

00:57:21.681 --> 00:57:24.551
You're the one who trashed the place and you want me to pay for cleaning?

00:57:25.621 --> 00:57:28.021
I've been letting this slide, but you...

00:57:29.251 --> 00:57:32.091
You've got some nerve, don't you? Talking back to me.

00:57:33.091 --> 00:57:34.091
Let go of me.

00:57:36.061 --> 00:57:38.631
You little wench. Too poor to even graduate.

00:57:40.761 --> 00:57:43.231
Hey! Snap out of it. It's the middle of the day.

00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:45.641
So what? I'm leaving the country anyway.

00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:49.241
- That wench has no bodyguard now! - Dude, are you crazy?

00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:54.011
That delivery girl, Si On. She'll learn without a job or bike.

00:57:55.111 --> 00:57:57.081
Hey, knock it off!

00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:03.191
You treat a poor customer like this? The cleaning fee is your settlement.

00:58:09.961 --> 00:58:11.161
That's my son.

00:58:15.231 --> 00:58:16.631
So you knew all this when you came here.

00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:31.911
I am so sorry.

00:58:32.221 --> 00:58:34.921
I'll do everything in my power to make this right.

00:58:35.221 --> 00:58:37.721
I'm not an unreasonable man.

00:58:37.921 --> 00:58:40.891
If I have something to answer for, I'll take full responsibility. Yes.

00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:54.941
That jerk is dead, right? Hey, don't worry about it.

00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:56.771
My dad will take care of everything.

00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:03.211
So who should take responsibility for this one?

00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:08.221
Your son? Or should I say you, Councilman?

00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:33.611
Fire!

00:59:34.411 --> 00:59:35.711
Hey, get out! Quick!

00:59:41.921 --> 00:59:44.191
What do we do? What are we going to do?

00:59:46.591 --> 00:59:47.791
That jerk...

00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:50.591
He's not dead?

00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:59.671
Oh no, that's Si On's scooter. Si On!

01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:05.011
Why don't you be straight with me?

01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.041
Is that why you're here? To threaten me?

01:00:08.381 --> 01:00:10.011
Threaten you?

01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:14.421
I wouldn't threaten someone over their son.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:18.421
I'm here to negotiate, Councilman Choi Woong Sik.

01:00:20.561 --> 01:00:25.491
If you withdraw your candidacy from this election,

01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:29.601
I will let you walk away from this.

01:00:31.871 --> 01:00:34.941
The assault on Si On and the attempted murder of Pillip,

01:00:35.641 --> 01:00:39.411
as well as threatening the victim and trying to cover up the truth.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:42.211
If you take full responsibility and resign,

01:00:43.981 --> 01:00:46.021
I'll let you walk.

01:00:51.821 --> 01:00:54.991
So, what's your answer?

01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:57.931
Would you rather find out what a real threat...

01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:00.261
feels like?

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:04.701
(Achievement Award)

01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:58.221
(Shin's Project)

01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:01.961
This won't hold up as evidence in court.

01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:04.091
We need more evidence.

01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:06.901
Who has time to take down villains by the book?

01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:11.171
I, Candidate Number Nine, Shin Jay, will make it happen!

01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:16.541
If we unify our campaigns and join forces...

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:22.511
- Just steamroll them all. - I guess that's our only option.

01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:24.381
I might not look it, but I'm a good fighter.

01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.221
I have to complete it.

01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:28.351
The election!
