00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:46.356
Mr. Zhou,

00:01:46.757 --> 00:01:48.397
my mother mentioned that you're

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:49.757
in new medical tech.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.516
Ms. Ma invested in you.

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:53.477
You're so busy every day.

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.117
I'm so grateful that you still remember

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:56.076
who I am.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.156
Thanks to Xu Yan for the introduction.

00:01:58.837 --> 00:01:59.316
Xu Yan.

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:00.557
Toast you.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:01.956
I have to drive.

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:02.837
Alright.

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:05.997
Let's eat.

00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:12.316
How long have you met?

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:14.277
We...

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:15.077
Xu Yan and I

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:16.196
have quite some history.

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.476
We met when we first came to Jingzhou
to start our business.

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:23.636
So it's been long.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:24.636
Right.

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:26.837
But over these years,

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:27.797
we've all been busy

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:29.036
in our own fields.

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:29.957
So

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:31.237
we hardly met.

00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:33.232
True, we hardly met,

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:34.916
but we've stayed in contact.

00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.237
Moreover, I'm very close to her family.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.557
I often chat with her parents

00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:40.636
by overseas calls.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:44.557
That close?

00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:46.357
You should meet more often.

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:48.517
It's my fault.

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:49.557
Over these years,

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.596
I've thrown myself into work

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.117
and drifted apart

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.756
from my friends.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.476
Asking Xu Yan for help

00:02:58.557 --> 00:02:59.316
this time we met.

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:00.557
Sorry about that.

00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:03.196
Mr. Shen.

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:04.876
She knows me well.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.677
I'm direct.

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:08.876
I asked her to contact you

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:11.196
for your help with my company.

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:13.077
Haoming.

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:15.277
There's something

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.476
I haven't told you.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:18.636
Zeyuan's company

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:20.636
is in medical tech.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.316
I think Jinda Group

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.237
lacks sufficient expertise
in medical fields.

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:25.196
This time...

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:26.156
I get it.

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:29.196
I had similar concerns before.

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:30.316
A few days ago,

00:03:30.316 --> 00:03:31.916
I had a chat with Mr. Xu on the phone.

00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:33.316
He said

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.237
that every industry is embracing

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:36.077
new technologies now.

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:38.077
He strongly advised me to meet Mr. Shen

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:38.837
and have a talk.

00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:42.916
Our group invests widely.

00:03:44.077 --> 00:03:45.036
If it's a good project,

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.117
we're open.

00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:46.997
Great.

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:49.517
Well,

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.716
Mr. Xu has become an authority

00:03:52.077 --> 00:03:53.156
in construction

00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:54.476
after years of dedication.

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:56.077
But he remains

00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:56.957
attentive to sectors

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:58.196
like high-tech.

00:03:58.517 --> 00:04:00.036
That open mind

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:01.277
is truly admirable.

00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:02.436
It's my fault.

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:04.077
I don't communicate enough

00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:04.997
with my in-laws.

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:06.316
I'll work on it.

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:08.277
Strive to do better.

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:08.876
Cheers.

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:10.916
Don't just talk.

00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:11.636
Let's eat.

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:14.036
Enjoy your meal.

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:15.237
I'll step out.

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:16.357
Take care.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:17.797
Enjoy.

00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:20.917
Mr. Shen.

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:22.316
I'll briefly introduce

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:23.076
my projects.

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:23.717
Eat first.

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:26.797
Okay.

00:05:24.997 --> 00:05:26.557
Your behavior surprised me.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:28.956
I thought we've reached a consensus.

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:31.117
We were on the same side.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:33.157
We never were.

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:37.836
That's harsh.

00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:40.597
I've been covering for you.

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:41.797
And you repay me

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:43.357
by blocking me?

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:52.917
Did I speak too much just now?

00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.436
Did I cause you any trouble?

00:05:54.836 --> 00:05:55.717
Would your husband

00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:57.076
suddenly get the urge

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.076
to call his father-in-law overseas

00:05:59.076 --> 00:05:59.997
on a whim?

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:13.237
If you keep resisting me,

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:15.797
I really can't guarantee

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:17.196
what I'll say next.

00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:21.037
No matter what you'll say,

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:23.597
I won't let Shen Haoming

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:25.316
get dragged into your scam.

00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:27.597
Worst case, we both go down.

00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:30.117
I'll face the consequences,

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:31.756
you too.

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:33.396
You've got everything you want.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:36.436
Can you discard them?

00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:39.276
You're bluffing.

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:41.357
You're scared, actually.

00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:42.636
You know very well

00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:44.836
you'll lose the most in the end.

00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:46.677
What do I have to fear?

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:48.876
I have nothing to lose.

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:49.717
I have no fear!

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:50.557
Good.

00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:53.037
Then go tell Shen Haoming

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:54.836
the whole truth right now.

00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:02.797
Seems you're really

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.237
trying to be his perfect wife.

00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:06.797
Fine.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:10.037
Don't want to use his money?

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:13.477
Give yours

00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:15.997
to me.

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:21.276
You have one night to think.

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.797
Or I'll expose you online.

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:35.157
A friendly reminder to you.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.237
A man drowning in debt

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:44.396
is a devil.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.557
Remember to pay up.

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:27.597
Otherwise,

00:08:27.597 --> 00:08:29.557
I'll haunt you like one.

00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:37.156
What are you doing?

00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:50.556
(Zhou Zeyuan)
Look into this guy for me.

00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:53.636
Okay.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:02.117
I've told you.

00:09:03.437 --> 00:09:04.717
I won't help you.

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:07.437
Solve your own mess.

00:09:08.117 --> 00:09:08.676
And

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:10.036
don't

00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:11.036
call me again.

00:09:13.237 --> 00:09:13.796
Yan.

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:21.276
Who's that?

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:24.077
Work call.

00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:26.597
What's wrong?

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:27.556
Did I awake you?

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:29.237
It's nothing.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.876
(New message received)

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.237
If it's work-related,

00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.156
is there anything I can help with?

00:09:37.317 --> 00:09:38.156
No.

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.636
They just informed me

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.117
tomorrow's guests

00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:42.477
may cancel

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:43.997
due to weather.

00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:45.437
I told them

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:47.717
to handle it on their own.

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.437
You seem tired lately.

00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:54.096
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:09:59.276 --> 00:10:00.357
A little, indeed.

00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:02.796
I have

00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:03.837
two shows at once.

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:06.516
And I just started anchoring.

00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:08.396
It's exhausting.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.357
If it's too much,

00:10:12.117 --> 00:10:12.756
just

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:14.197
drop one.

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:17.636
But you know

00:10:17.636 --> 00:10:19.477
being a news anchor is my dream.

00:10:21.077 --> 00:10:23.117
And I built Family Feast from scratch.

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.036
I can't give up either.

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:27.796
Then I support you.

00:10:28.477 --> 00:10:29.556
Keep both.

00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:33.357
You changed so fast.

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:36.796
(Zhou Zeyuan)
I'll always choose your choice.

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:40.036
(Xu Yan, think about the consequences
of refusing me.)

00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:51.376
(Phone off)

00:10:56.676 --> 00:10:58.276
Having someone supporting me

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:00.357
feels good.

00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:03.197
I stand by what I said.

00:11:03.717 --> 00:11:05.197
Do whatever you want.

00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:07.357
Mistakes don't matter.

00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:08.997
Even if you fail,

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:10.957
we can start over.

00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:22.636
Sorry.

00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:24.837
The number you dialed is powered off.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.624
(Xu Yan)

00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:57.997
No answer.

00:11:58.237 --> 00:11:59.237
No reply.

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:00.437
Xu Yan.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:01.796
What are you thinking?

00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:03.156
I've got nothing to say.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.717
My cash flow's gone,

00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:05.516
salaries unpaid,

00:12:05.597 --> 00:12:06.997
investors digging into my books.

00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:08.477
My company's about to collapse.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.636
I'm cornered.

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:10.477
I'm telling you.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:11.837
If I go down,

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:12.916
I'm dragging you.

00:12:12.997 --> 00:12:13.957
Understood?

00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:16.117
Let go of me!

00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:17.904
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

00:12:18.477 --> 00:12:19.837
What are you doing?

00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:21.837
Who are you?

00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:23.197
Who are you?

00:12:23.197 --> 00:12:24.117
None of your business.

00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:24.876
Don't step in.

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:25.317
Go away!

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:26.916
Listen up.

00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:27.837
There are many

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:28.437
cameras here.

00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:29.237
All recording.

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:30.224
I'll call the police!

00:12:30.477 --> 00:12:31.276
Right now.

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:36.156
Hello?

00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:37.077
Police?

00:12:37.396 --> 00:12:38.317
Someone's harassing me!

00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:39.197
Guards!

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:40.197
Help!

00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:53.296
Drink something warm.

00:12:53.997 --> 00:12:54.357
Thanks.

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:00.717
Yan.

00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:02.957
Who was that guy?

00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:04.437
What's going on?

00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:08.916
Just someone I knew.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:09.997
We had a small dispute.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:11.636
But it's all settled now.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:12.437
Don't worry.

00:13:14.396 --> 00:13:16.516
He looked menacing.

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.477
Didn't seem a small matter.

00:13:22.957 --> 00:13:24.117
You are still the same.

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:26.156
Keeping everything bottled up.

00:13:26.997 --> 00:13:28.077
Truly, I may not

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:28.876
be much help

00:13:28.957 --> 00:13:30.197
if you tell me.

00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:36.156
You're still the same too,

00:13:37.477 --> 00:13:38.676
hot-tempered.

00:13:39.876 --> 00:13:40.676
Thank you.

00:13:42.357 --> 00:13:43.676
I should be thanking you.

00:13:44.317 --> 00:13:45.756
Yu Yiming told me everything.

00:13:46.756 --> 00:13:49.997
You paid my adult education tuition

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.276
for next semester.

00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:52.837
Why?

00:13:53.357 --> 00:13:54.317
Why hide it?

00:13:55.077 --> 00:13:55.957
Trying to be a saint?

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:57.117
Do good deeds anonymously?

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:58.556
It's nothing.

00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:03.156
So today you came to see me?

00:14:06.876 --> 00:14:08.117
To give you this.

00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:11.516
Some makeup,

00:14:11.997 --> 00:14:13.676
just to thank you.

00:14:16.117 --> 00:14:17.437
I was waiting

00:14:17.477 --> 00:14:18.396
at the main entrance.

00:14:18.597 --> 00:14:20.317
But you drove straight to the basement,

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:21.117
didn't notice me.

00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:22.077
So I went

00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:23.317
down to find you.

00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:25.197
And...

00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:26.317
About

00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:27.997
Lin Tao's matter,

00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:30.237
I was too harsh.

00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:31.516
I wanted to apologize.

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:33.036
I'm sorry, Yan.

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:40.756
I was impulsive too.

00:14:43.036 --> 00:14:43.756
I'm sorry.

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:46.796
I like the gift. Thanks.

00:14:46.997 --> 00:14:47.796
I'll keep it.

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:55.876
Has his bothered you again?

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:57.396
No.

00:14:57.916 --> 00:14:58.597
Good.

00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:00.957
I can't help you much.

00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:02.156
But Yan,

00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:03.317
as long as I'm here,

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:05.276
nobody's bullying you.

00:15:05.756 --> 00:15:06.480
I'll protect you.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.036
So today,

00:15:10.516 --> 00:15:11.276
your treat.

00:15:12.276 --> 00:15:13.437
I already paid.

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:17.904
That's not your style.

00:15:18.676 --> 00:15:19.317
Hello.

00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:22.516
Your most expensive cake,

00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:23.396
please.

00:15:23.437 --> 00:15:23.837
Thanks.

00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:24.624
- One moment.
- Thank you.

00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:26.036
Thank you.

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:28.516
Your treat.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:32.317
Yan.

00:15:32.477 --> 00:15:33.876
Here's the news file.

00:15:33.957 --> 00:15:34.516
Thanks.

00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:37.756
Dong Chao.

00:15:39.357 --> 00:15:40.077
Close the door.

00:15:45.207 --> 00:15:52.112
(Incoming call from Qiao Jianbin)

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:56.276
What's wrong?

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:57.036
Qiao Yan.

00:15:57.597 --> 00:15:58.916
Your mom and I are in Jingzhou.

00:15:59.197 --> 00:16:00.437
Sending you the hotel address.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:02.117
Come right now.

00:16:02.437 --> 00:16:04.357
Don't ask. We'll talk in person.

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.800
(From Qiao Jianbin
Wuseshi Hotel)

00:16:24.997 --> 00:16:26.197
Why are you here?

00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:27.916
Come in.

00:16:31.876 --> 00:16:32.717
You've arrived.

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:11.637
I invited your parents here.

00:17:13.316 --> 00:17:13.957
Qiao Yan.

00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:16.637
No one loves us more

00:17:17.157 --> 00:17:18.637
than our parents.

00:17:19.836 --> 00:17:20.877
As children,

00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:22.356
we shouldn't hide anything

00:17:22.717 --> 00:17:23.917
from them.

00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:26.957
Maybe you've had

00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:28.237
some conflicts.

00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:29.516
But I believe

00:17:29.877 --> 00:17:31.116
if you sit down

00:17:31.397 --> 00:17:32.237
and talk openly

00:17:32.477 --> 00:17:33.756
with each other,

00:17:34.276 --> 00:17:34.836
everything

00:17:34.997 --> 00:17:36.437
will be resolved.

00:17:37.197 --> 00:17:37.877
Right, Mr. Qiao?

00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:42.917
Qiao Yan is a good girl.

00:17:43.677 --> 00:17:45.276
Don't be too angry.

00:17:45.316 --> 00:17:46.036
Take care.

00:17:46.516 --> 00:17:47.836
I've arranged the rooms.

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:49.316
Stay as long as you want.

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:50.477
Then I'll head back.

00:17:50.796 --> 00:17:51.356
Okay.

00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:52.877
I'm leaving.

00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:17.836
Where did you get the nerve

00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:20.836
to fake your parents' jobs

00:18:21.197 --> 00:18:23.516
and hire actors at your wedding?

00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:24.917
Who gave you the courage

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:26.997
to tell such a lie?

00:18:27.437 --> 00:18:28.717
I, Qiao Jianbin,

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:29.756
have never done

00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:31.397
a shameful thing in my life.

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.677
How did I raise a daughter like you?

00:18:33.877 --> 00:18:34.677
Calm down.

00:18:37.437 --> 00:18:38.157
Yan.

00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:40.556
Just tell your father the truth.

00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:41.877
Why did you do this?

00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:43.116
Why?

00:18:43.877 --> 00:18:46.116
Greedy for wealth
and blinded by ambition.

00:18:46.516 --> 00:18:47.596
To marry into riches,

00:18:47.677 --> 00:18:49.516
you've abandoned all moral principles!

00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:54.437
I didn't take a single penny
from the Shens.

00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:57.356
My feelings for Shen Haoming are real.

00:18:58.356 --> 00:18:59.076
I love him,

00:18:59.397 --> 00:19:00.477
so I want to marry him

00:19:00.516 --> 00:19:01.677
and become his wife.

00:19:03.157 --> 00:19:04.157
I did nothing wrong

00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:05.877
with that.

00:19:06.356 --> 00:19:07.796
Ridiculous!

00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:09.556
You fooled everyone.

00:19:10.076 --> 00:19:11.917
You played us all!

00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:12.957
You think that

00:19:12.997 --> 00:19:14.397
will erase everything?

00:19:14.437 --> 00:19:15.437
Who would believe that?

00:19:15.637 --> 00:19:16.596
I don't need you to.

00:19:18.677 --> 00:19:19.516
I never

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:20.356
expected

00:19:20.437 --> 00:19:21.836
you to understand me.

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.316
I just want to say.

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:24.957
No matter when

00:19:25.356 --> 00:19:26.796
I met someone like Shen Haoming,

00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:27.756
I would use

00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:29.677
any means

00:19:30.717 --> 00:19:31.796
necessary

00:19:32.556 --> 00:19:33.437
to be with him.

00:19:33.717 --> 00:19:35.237
But you shouldn't have deceived him!

00:19:35.237 --> 00:19:36.957
I didn't want to.

00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:40.917
It's just that since I was little,

00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:43.677
I knew I could only rely on myself.

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:50.437
Yan.

00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:52.957
When you were a kid,

00:19:52.997 --> 00:19:54.316
we didn't raise you.

00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:57.957
But we took you back later.

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.997
We've raised you all these years.

00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:03.157
You can't blame your mistakes

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:04.917
all on us!

00:20:09.596 --> 00:20:10.157
No.

00:20:17.836 --> 00:20:19.796
You'll not understand
what you did wrong.

00:20:20.556 --> 00:20:21.836
My only mistake

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.197
was not exposing you earlier!

00:20:25.076 --> 00:20:26.756
I'll go confront the Shen family now

00:20:26.917 --> 00:20:28.076
and expose everything!

00:20:28.197 --> 00:20:28.917
Qiao! Qiao!

00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:29.756
Don't go! Don't!

00:20:29.877 --> 00:20:30.556
Calm down!

00:20:30.717 --> 00:20:31.477
Let go!

00:20:31.717 --> 00:20:32.756
Think about Yan!

00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:34.437
If you do this, her career is ruined!

00:20:34.596 --> 00:20:36.076
If I didn't know, fine.

00:20:36.197 --> 00:20:37.596
But now, if I cover for her,

00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:38.997
I'd be failing as a father!

00:20:38.997 --> 00:20:40.437
She's already married.

00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:41.516
You can't do this.

00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:42.756
What's this act about?

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:49.997
Well.

00:20:51.556 --> 00:20:52.276
What are you

00:20:53.717 --> 00:20:54.957
acting out here?

00:20:56.116 --> 00:20:56.836
Parents

00:20:57.116 --> 00:20:58.157
brokenhearted

00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:00.397
over their daughter's mistakes?

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.477
Do you really care?

00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.596
This is how I grew up.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:12.877
You never cared about me!

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:14.917
I fought so hard

00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:16.157
to get where I am today,

00:21:17.397 --> 00:21:18.717
to get a loving husband.

00:21:21.157 --> 00:21:22.116
Are you unhappy?

00:21:27.157 --> 00:21:27.877
I got it.

00:21:29.157 --> 00:21:30.157
You think

00:21:30.197 --> 00:21:30.957
this life

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.637
should've belonged to Qiao Lin,

00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:33.276
not me, right?

00:21:36.237 --> 00:21:37.036
Or you want

00:21:37.036 --> 00:21:38.637
to expose me to the Shen family

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:39.316
so you can

00:21:39.316 --> 00:21:40.677
extort money from me?

00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:43.836
Fine. No problem.

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:45.237
I'll pay.

00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:46.864
What did you say?

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:50.677
How could you think that?

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.116
You...

00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:56.756
Are you still

00:21:56.796 --> 00:21:57.957
a Qiao family's girl?

00:21:58.356 --> 00:21:59.756
Do you still bear our surname?

00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:01.036
I don't bear Qiao.

00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:05.877
My name is Xu Yan.

00:22:07.237 --> 00:22:07.836
Good.

00:22:10.397 --> 00:22:13.036
From now on,
we're no longer father and daughter.

00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:16.397
You are not part of this family anymore!

00:22:16.437 --> 00:22:16.957
No!

00:22:17.997 --> 00:22:18.637
Qiao!

00:23:19.824 --> 00:23:22.416
(Secretary Chen)

00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:24.076
- Go ahead.
- Mr. Shen.

00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:25.237
Your wife

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:26.556
sold the car

00:23:27.397 --> 00:23:28.116
you gifted her.

00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:33.477
Got it.

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:44.116
I've given you the money.

00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:48.197
What do you want?

00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:53.637
Are you throwing scraps on me?

00:23:54.116 --> 00:23:55.116
Do you know how much

00:23:55.116 --> 00:23:56.596
my company spends every day?

00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:00.116
Zhou Zeyuan, I'm warning you.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:01.556
This is the first

00:24:02.477 --> 00:24:03.596
and the last time.

00:24:05.756 --> 00:24:06.756
Take this money

00:24:06.756 --> 00:24:07.637
as your hush fee,

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:08.596
for your last life.

00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:09.997
I won't tolerate

00:24:10.276 --> 00:24:11.877
endless extortion.

00:24:16.637 --> 00:24:17.637
Try this again,

00:24:22.237 --> 00:24:23.556
and I'll call the police.

00:24:25.556 --> 00:24:26.997
But the deficit's too large.

00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:28.877
This is far from enough.

00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:33.596
If my company crashes,

00:24:33.796 --> 00:24:35.356
everyone will come

00:24:35.397 --> 00:24:36.477
demanding repayment.

00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:38.877
Then it'll be do-or-die.

00:24:42.677 --> 00:24:44.397
But the one who should be afraid

00:24:44.397 --> 00:24:45.316
isn't me.

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:46.437
It's you.

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:49.276
Everything you schemed so hard to get

00:24:49.276 --> 00:24:50.556
will turn to ashes.

00:24:51.836 --> 00:24:52.556
Xu Yan.

00:24:53.437 --> 00:24:55.356
Do you dare gamble everything?

00:24:55.717 --> 00:24:56.637
Can't you see

00:24:56.717 --> 00:24:57.756
I've been

00:24:57.836 --> 00:24:58.957
giving you chances?

00:25:00.836 --> 00:25:01.316
Fine.

00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:07.556
Give it a try then.

00:25:09.877 --> 00:25:11.157
See who can go further.

00:25:20.316 --> 00:25:21.477
If I end up in jail,

00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.796
- at least I'll have you with me.
- Let go!

00:25:37.197 --> 00:25:38.356
Ten million per blow.

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:41.637
Another strike?

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:46.416
(Mr. Shen)

00:25:47.677 --> 00:25:48.796
Your husband's calling.

00:25:55.504 --> 00:25:56.720
(Mr. Shen)

00:25:59.024 --> 00:25:59.984
(Mr. Shen)

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:02.076
Hello, Mr. Shen.

00:26:02.237 --> 00:26:03.237
What's up?

00:26:03.756 --> 00:26:04.677
2 PM.

00:26:05.237 --> 00:26:06.157
Golf game.

00:26:06.276 --> 00:26:06.836
Available?

00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:08.796
Of course.

00:26:11.276 --> 00:26:12.637
He walked into this himself.

00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:13.516
Not my fault.

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.397
Listen well.

00:26:21.877 --> 00:26:23.276
If you hurt him,

00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:24.997
I won't let you go.

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:28.316
You want to expose me?

00:26:29.197 --> 00:26:29.877
Go ahead!

00:26:39.036 --> 00:26:39.917
Mr. Shen.

00:26:40.677 --> 00:26:42.637
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

00:26:43.237 --> 00:26:44.877
Xu Yan is with me now.

00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:46.877
She says she's coming too.

00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:48.836
Got it.

00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:50.437
Goodbye.

00:26:56.237 --> 00:26:56.997
To put it simply,

00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:58.036
the idea is to combine

00:26:58.036 --> 00:26:59.157
the thinking and experience

00:26:59.237 --> 00:27:00.516
of top medical experts

00:27:00.756 --> 00:27:01.957
with new technologies

00:27:02.036 --> 00:27:03.437
in each case.

00:27:03.877 --> 00:27:04.756
Then we can replicate

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.556
countless top doctors

00:27:06.637 --> 00:27:07.516
to serve patients.

00:27:08.437 --> 00:27:09.677
Jinda Group hasn't touched

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:11.677
the medical field yet.

00:27:12.276 --> 00:27:13.197
But I'm interested.

00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:15.237
What's the return rate?

00:27:16.917 --> 00:27:17.917
This round, we're raising

00:27:17.917 --> 00:27:18.877
100 million.

00:27:19.276 --> 00:27:20.036
I saved

00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:20.877
50 million for you.

00:27:21.237 --> 00:27:22.276
Based on current

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:22.957
figures,

00:27:23.036 --> 00:27:23.877
the annualized return

00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:24.957
is around 20%.

00:27:25.197 --> 00:27:26.076
10 million a year.

00:27:26.316 --> 00:27:26.796
Of course,

00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:28.756
the more you put in,
the higher the returns.

00:27:38.796 --> 00:27:39.477
Nice shot.

00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:40.556
Your turn.

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:41.756
Okay.

00:27:49.316 --> 00:27:50.556
Looks like

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.197
you haven't been practicing.

00:27:53.637 --> 00:27:54.877
Can't compare with you.

00:27:55.677 --> 00:27:56.157
Mr. Shen.

00:27:56.556 --> 00:27:58.197
The project we discussed,

00:27:58.316 --> 00:27:59.677
I've been developing it for years.

00:28:00.477 --> 00:28:01.957
From medical R&D

00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:03.076
to data collection,

00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:04.437
our company leads

00:28:04.437 --> 00:28:05.796
in the industry.

00:28:06.356 --> 00:28:07.076
I believe,

00:28:07.356 --> 00:28:09.356
with your financial support,

00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:10.477
it'll take off.

00:28:10.796 --> 00:28:12.036
Not just substantial returns,

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:13.076
but also solving

00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:14.276
real problems for patients.

00:28:14.397 --> 00:28:15.477
Good for the people.

00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:16.356
Okay.

00:28:16.957 --> 00:28:18.356
I've got the picture.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:20.157
I'll discuss it internally.

00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:22.957
Should be feasible.

00:28:23.197 --> 00:28:25.356
My secretary will update you.

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:27.316
Okay.

00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:28.957
Thank you so much

00:28:29.076 --> 00:28:29.917
for this opportunity.

00:28:30.036 --> 00:28:30.556
No problem.

00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:31.516
I'll take my leave.

00:28:32.437 --> 00:28:32.836
Xu Yan.

00:28:33.157 --> 00:28:33.877
I'm heading out.

00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:36.276
Goodbye.

00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:37.157
Goodbye.

00:28:45.237 --> 00:28:45.677
What's up?

00:28:50.276 --> 00:28:50.836
Haoming.

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:52.717
I don't think

00:28:52.717 --> 00:28:53.917
you should invest.

00:28:55.877 --> 00:28:56.717
First,

00:28:57.316 --> 00:28:58.237
we don't know much

00:28:58.276 --> 00:28:59.197
about medicine.

00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:00.516
Second,

00:29:01.356 --> 00:29:02.917
we don't know his company's

00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:03.756
operations either.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.717
It's too risky.

00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:10.877
Don't do it for my sake.

00:29:11.677 --> 00:29:12.556
I'm not

00:29:13.477 --> 00:29:14.637
that close to him.

00:29:15.316 --> 00:29:16.197
So,

00:29:16.917 --> 00:29:17.756
the investment...

00:29:18.237 --> 00:29:19.756
Actually,

00:29:20.637 --> 00:29:21.997
the funds he wants aren't huge.

00:29:22.756 --> 00:29:24.076
The medical field

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:26.036
isn't our business,

00:29:26.917 --> 00:29:27.877
so I won't use

00:29:27.957 --> 00:29:28.756
Jinda's funds.

00:29:29.477 --> 00:29:31.276
I'll find other investors.

00:29:31.637 --> 00:29:32.437
It'll work out.

00:29:35.556 --> 00:29:37.116
With you handling it, of course.

00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:41.197
But 50 million

00:29:41.397 --> 00:29:42.437
isn't small.

00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.596
The risks and potential losses

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:45.877
are

00:29:45.877 --> 00:29:47.036
within acceptable limits.

00:29:47.596 --> 00:29:48.356
I can handle it.

00:29:48.677 --> 00:29:49.397
Trust me.

00:29:51.316 --> 00:29:51.796
Let's go.

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:53.477
Haoming.

00:29:57.756 --> 00:29:59.237
There's something I want to tell you.

00:29:59.316 --> 00:30:00.717
I want to tell you,

00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:03.157
I just want you by my side,

00:30:03.637 --> 00:30:05.276
happy

00:30:05.717 --> 00:30:06.717
and carefree.

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:09.677
Not frowning.

00:30:11.836 --> 00:30:12.637
Smile.

00:30:17.836 --> 00:30:18.397
Let's go.

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:37.477
Mr. Shen.

00:30:38.116 --> 00:30:39.437
Mr. Huang's secretary called,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.936
asking if you're available
the day after tomorrow.

00:30:42.197 --> 00:30:42.796
He will bring

00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:43.717
some important guests

00:30:43.796 --> 00:30:44.477
to play golf.

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:45.796
No problem.

00:30:46.116 --> 00:30:46.477
And,

00:30:47.437 --> 00:30:48.917
Zhou Zeyuan's called multiple times.

00:30:49.036 --> 00:30:49.637
Looks like

00:30:49.917 --> 00:30:50.717
he's about to crack.

00:30:52.836 --> 00:30:53.397
No rush.

00:30:54.036 --> 00:30:54.796
Let him wait.

00:30:56.917 --> 00:30:59.596
Schedule a meeting with
the investment department in 15 minutes.

00:30:59.596 --> 00:31:00.116
Understood.

00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:21.356
Mr. Zhou.

00:31:21.997 --> 00:31:22.957
Our account funds

00:31:23.036 --> 00:31:24.116
can only sustain us

00:31:24.157 --> 00:31:24.997
for two days.

00:31:25.756 --> 00:31:27.076
Keep calling Shen Haoming.

00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:29.157
I've called numerous times.

00:31:29.397 --> 00:31:30.836
His secretary always makes excuses.

00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:32.197
Enough!

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:34.197
Just call!

00:31:34.397 --> 00:31:35.197
Or tell me

00:31:35.356 --> 00:31:36.036
where else

00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:37.036
we can get money!

00:31:38.437 --> 00:31:39.157
Make the call!

00:31:53.677 --> 00:31:54.397
Secretary Chen.

00:31:54.796 --> 00:31:55.717
Congras, Mr. Zhou.

00:31:56.316 --> 00:31:57.076
Mr. Shen

00:31:57.157 --> 00:31:58.637
has agreed to invest.

00:31:59.237 --> 00:31:59.877
Moreover,

00:32:00.116 --> 00:32:01.717
he's willing to add more.

00:32:02.157 --> 00:32:02.836
However,

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:04.997
he wants

00:32:04.997 --> 00:32:06.276
a 6% higher return.

00:32:06.877 --> 00:32:07.516
Is that okay?

00:32:08.157 --> 00:32:08.596
Sure.

00:32:08.717 --> 00:32:09.637
No problem at all.

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:11.477
Secretary Chen,

00:32:11.877 --> 00:32:13.157
please inform Mr. Shen

00:32:13.397 --> 00:32:14.516
I'll make arrangements now.

00:32:14.877 --> 00:32:16.036
When he's not busy,

00:32:16.116 --> 00:32:17.796
I'll visit with the contract.

00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:19.957
There's no hurry.

00:32:20.677 --> 00:32:21.596
Mr. Shen

00:32:21.836 --> 00:32:22.677
thinks your sector

00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:24.076
is potential.

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:25.116
However,

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:26.997
it's his personal interest.

00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:28.116
The money

00:32:28.116 --> 00:32:29.157
won't be from

00:32:29.157 --> 00:32:29.796
Jinda Group.

00:32:30.316 --> 00:32:31.477
A professional agent will

00:32:31.997 --> 00:32:32.796
handle the contract.

00:32:33.237 --> 00:32:33.997
He'll contact you

00:32:33.997 --> 00:32:34.637
later.

00:32:35.356 --> 00:32:36.877
The funds will

00:32:37.796 --> 00:32:38.556
be transferred

00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:39.756
in batches

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:40.796
within three months.

00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:42.516
Understood.

00:32:43.076 --> 00:32:44.276
Don't worry.

00:32:44.356 --> 00:32:44.917
I won't tell

00:32:44.957 --> 00:32:46.356
anyone about this.

00:32:46.877 --> 00:32:47.957
I'm grateful to him

00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:49.437
for recognizing my project

00:32:49.556 --> 00:32:51.036
and me.

00:32:51.717 --> 00:32:52.237
Okay.

00:32:53.076 --> 00:32:54.477
I'll convey

00:32:54.637 --> 00:32:55.917
your gratitude to him.

00:32:56.356 --> 00:32:56.836
Goodbye.

00:32:57.997 --> 00:32:58.836
Okay. Goodbye.

00:33:07.312 --> 00:33:08.688
(Four months later)

00:33:08.796 --> 00:33:09.356
Miss Xu.

00:33:09.836 --> 00:33:11.437
Nice job hosting the finance news.

00:33:11.917 --> 00:33:13.237
Since you've joined Family Feast,

00:33:13.477 --> 00:33:14.116
from today,

00:33:14.596 --> 00:33:16.717
take charge of that show too.

00:34:17.328 --> 00:34:18.192
(Zhou Zeyuan)

00:34:23.116 --> 00:34:24.437
(It suddenly dawned on me)

00:34:25.236 --> 00:34:27.156
(that it's been four months)

00:34:27.997 --> 00:34:30.156
(since Zhou Zeyuan last contacted me.)

00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:35.357
(He disappeared)

00:34:36.397 --> 00:34:37.516
(without a trace.)

00:34:50.357 --> 00:34:51.236
Is dinner ready?

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.116
Yes. Go wash your hands.

00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:54.672
Smells great.

00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:56.596
Zhou Zeyuan's

00:34:56.917 --> 00:34:57.556
arrested.

00:35:02.116 --> 00:35:03.357
When?

00:35:03.596 --> 00:35:04.757
I just heard about it.

00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:10.437
(Recently,)

00:35:10.596 --> 00:35:12.556
(head of a well-known medical company,)

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:13.397
(Zhou Zeyuan,)

00:35:13.716 --> 00:35:17.116
(has been arrested for financial fraud,)

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:19.877
(collusion with foreign charities,
and illegally transferring)

00:35:19.877 --> 00:35:20.877
(investors' funds.)

00:35:20.877 --> 00:35:21.516
That's too much.

00:35:21.636 --> 00:35:23.196
(He was apprehended at a Macau casino,)

00:35:23.477 --> 00:35:24.397
(for investigation.)

00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:36.036
Honey.

00:35:37.196 --> 00:35:37.997
You've promised

00:35:37.997 --> 00:35:39.556
to invest in him.

00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:41.437
Will this affect you?

00:35:41.676 --> 00:35:42.516
No.

00:35:43.757 --> 00:35:46.917
I heard he was a gambling addict,

00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:49.296
so I ended the cooperation long ago.

00:35:49.797 --> 00:35:50.877
Moreover, my funds

00:35:50.877 --> 00:35:53.156
are managed by professional brokers.

00:35:53.757 --> 00:35:55.076
There shouldn't be any issues.

00:35:59.156 --> 00:35:59.797
That's great.

00:36:00.397 --> 00:36:01.317
But you...

00:36:02.676 --> 00:36:03.917
You sold your car, didn't you?

00:36:13.757 --> 00:36:15.397
Because I heard Ms. Ma

00:36:16.917 --> 00:36:18.236
also invested heavily in him.

00:36:19.716 --> 00:36:21.877
She doesn't care about returns.

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:25.837
Why?

00:36:26.477 --> 00:36:27.397
As everyone knows,

00:36:28.317 --> 00:36:29.797
Ms. Ma's patronized

00:36:30.277 --> 00:36:31.196
many upstarts

00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:33.716
as Zhou Zeyuan.

00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:35.196
She enjoys being surrounded

00:36:35.357 --> 00:36:36.397
by those

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:38.236
promising youths.

00:36:39.516 --> 00:36:40.556
You fell for her act.

00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:47.236
Actually, she knew all along

00:36:47.236 --> 00:36:48.277
what Zhou was really like.

00:36:56.236 --> 00:36:57.516
Try the shrimp.

00:36:58.156 --> 00:36:59.357
Last time you said it's salty.

00:36:59.636 --> 00:37:00.036
How's it?

00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:01.997
Better?

00:37:05.437 --> 00:37:06.397
Not salty at all.

00:37:11.957 --> 00:37:12.556
Yan.

00:37:14.716 --> 00:37:16.236
If you want to invest

00:37:16.636 --> 00:37:17.317
in the future,

00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.236
just ask me for money.

00:37:20.357 --> 00:37:21.397
No need to sell your car.

00:37:33.477 --> 00:37:33.997
Tastes great.

00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:35.317
Eat more vegetables.

00:37:37.437 --> 00:37:38.236
What soup is this?

00:37:38.917 --> 00:37:39.437
Chicken soup.

00:37:40.317 --> 00:37:40.997
So nourishing?

00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:41.596
Right.

00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:54.196
Since he found out

00:37:54.236 --> 00:37:55.716
you sold your car,

00:37:56.156 --> 00:37:57.357
could he's discovered

00:37:57.357 --> 00:37:58.317
you lied to him?

00:38:03.957 --> 00:38:04.877
Probably not.

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:09.957
Zhou Zeyuan is terrifying.

00:38:10.397 --> 00:38:11.437
But why did he

00:38:11.437 --> 00:38:12.676
suddenly get caught?

00:38:14.556 --> 00:38:16.317
That's what puzzles me too.

00:38:16.917 --> 00:38:18.036
I feel like

00:38:19.076 --> 00:38:20.236
someone's helping me,

00:38:22.917 --> 00:38:24.116
but I don't know who.

00:38:33.357 --> 00:38:34.076
Never mind.

00:38:34.317 --> 00:38:34.997
Forget it.

00:38:35.437 --> 00:38:35.957
Anyway,

00:38:35.957 --> 00:38:37.036
it's resolved now.

00:38:37.156 --> 00:38:38.397
You should stop overthinking.

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:39.757
Maybe you're just lucky,

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.116
avoiding the dangers, right?

00:38:42.317 --> 00:38:42.917
But

00:38:43.236 --> 00:38:44.676
I still want to advise you.

00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:47.397
You can't keep hiding forever.

00:38:47.716 --> 00:38:49.357
Find a proper chance

00:38:49.516 --> 00:38:50.797
to explain to the Shen family.

00:38:51.317 --> 00:38:52.716
Your husband really loves you.

00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:53.997
Talk it through with him,

00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:55.196
and he'll forgive you.

00:38:55.477 --> 00:38:56.716
I do want to tell him.

00:38:59.757 --> 00:39:01.397
Just haven't found the right moment.

00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:04.076
Alright.

00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:06.397
That's good.

00:39:07.156 --> 00:39:08.716
I've been worried sick

00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:09.516
about this thing.

00:39:18.877 --> 00:39:19.636
It's ready.

00:39:21.236 --> 00:39:21.676
Eat up.

00:39:31.437 --> 00:39:32.076
Yu Yiming!

00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:34.397
Just off work?

00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:35.196
Had eaten?

00:39:35.596 --> 00:39:36.464
Yes, at the canteen.

00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:37.837
Xu Yan and I are here.

00:39:37.997 --> 00:39:38.997
Join us for more?

00:39:39.397 --> 00:39:40.357
The food here's good.

00:39:40.516 --> 00:39:41.797
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:39:41.797 --> 00:39:42.672
Just sit for a while.

00:39:43.116 --> 00:39:43.437
Come.

00:39:43.957 --> 00:39:44.277
Come.

00:39:44.477 --> 00:39:45.596
Try the lamb.

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:46.317
Thanks.

00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:47.596
Off work?

00:39:49.837 --> 00:39:50.236
Here.

00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:52.076
Alright.

00:39:52.317 --> 00:39:52.757
Enough.

00:39:53.877 --> 00:39:54.277
Xu Yan.

00:39:55.236 --> 00:39:55.877
Yesterday, I saw

00:39:55.877 --> 00:39:56.997
the financial news.

00:39:57.116 --> 00:39:57.676
Honestly,

00:39:57.712 --> 00:39:58.877
you look great on camera.

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:00.156
Stop teasing me.

00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:00.877
Just eat.

00:40:01.397 --> 00:40:02.036
I'm serious.

00:40:02.716 --> 00:40:03.036
Here.

00:40:03.357 --> 00:40:03.716
Try it.

00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:04.357
It's enough.

00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:06.437
Congratulations.

00:40:06.877 --> 00:40:08.156
You finally achieved your dream.

00:40:08.917 --> 00:40:09.397
Thank you.

00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:11.437
Sign an autograph for me later.

00:40:12.636 --> 00:40:13.397
When you're famous,

00:40:13.516 --> 00:40:14.997
I can show off

00:40:14.997 --> 00:40:15.797
to my coworkers.

00:40:16.156 --> 00:40:17.437
Don't overdo it, Yu Yiming.

00:40:19.716 --> 00:40:21.556
Not overdoing.

00:40:22.156 --> 00:40:22.716
Well,

00:40:23.357 --> 00:40:24.837
my coworkers

00:40:25.477 --> 00:40:27.236
all love watching that news

00:40:27.877 --> 00:40:28.596
and Family Feast.

00:40:29.196 --> 00:40:30.076
Since they learned

00:40:30.156 --> 00:40:31.757
we were high-school classmates,

00:40:32.156 --> 00:40:33.837
they talk about you all the time.

00:40:34.277 --> 00:40:34.757
Well,

00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:36.156
give me

00:40:36.196 --> 00:40:36.797
your autograph,

00:40:36.877 --> 00:40:37.477
okay?

00:40:38.317 --> 00:40:38.797
Qiao Lin.

00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:41.877
Isn't he tutoring you?

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:42.997
How's it going?

00:40:43.236 --> 00:40:44.116
Excellent, of course.

00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:44.877
Just of average.

00:40:52.757 --> 00:40:53.357
Forget it.

00:40:53.797 --> 00:40:54.357
We finally

00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:54.917
reunite today.

00:40:55.076 --> 00:40:55.837
This meal's on me.

00:40:56.076 --> 00:40:56.556
My treat.

00:40:57.397 --> 00:40:58.036
Your treat?

00:40:59.357 --> 00:40:59.997
Waiter!

00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:01.277
30 more plates of lamb!

00:41:04.236 --> 00:41:04.837
You...

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:06.997
Haven't seen Wolverine?

00:41:14.156 --> 00:41:15.196
The food was good today.

00:41:16.556 --> 00:41:16.997
Qiao Lin.

00:41:17.196 --> 00:41:17.596
What?

00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:18.957
What time to start?

00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:19.957
Starting what?

00:41:20.636 --> 00:41:21.277
The tutoring.

00:41:21.997 --> 00:41:23.277
After all that lamb?

00:41:24.036 --> 00:41:25.076
What's wrong with you?

00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:26.757
Overheated. Eaten too much lambs.

00:41:29.556 --> 00:41:30.236
Overheated?

00:41:31.636 --> 00:41:33.317
30 plates will do that.

00:42:33.036 --> 00:42:33.757
Are you busy?

00:42:40.116 --> 00:42:40.556
What's up?

00:42:45.877 --> 00:42:46.957
A friend

00:42:49.277 --> 00:42:50.477
just called me.

00:42:54.877 --> 00:42:56.076
She said before marriage,

00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:57.837
she hid something from her husband.

00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:04.596
Now she wants to confess.

00:43:09.116 --> 00:43:10.437
Why did she hide it?

00:43:16.196 --> 00:43:18.596
Afraid to ruin their relationship.

00:43:22.076 --> 00:43:22.957
And afraid

00:43:27.556 --> 00:43:29.156
he wouldn't have married her.

00:43:30.757 --> 00:43:32.877
How's their relationship now?

00:43:35.957 --> 00:43:36.437
Great.

00:43:39.596 --> 00:43:40.317
That's easy then.

00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:43.076
Then keep it hidden.

00:43:46.917 --> 00:43:48.277
Keep it hidden?

00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:01.437
- But I think...
- No buts.

00:44:05.196 --> 00:44:05.636
Listen.

00:44:14.596 --> 00:44:16.116
Tell your friend.

00:44:16.877 --> 00:44:18.357
Confession

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.156
is like a thorn

00:44:20.236 --> 00:44:21.516
in marriage.

00:44:23.676 --> 00:44:24.716
Principles

00:44:24.757 --> 00:44:25.917
are not needed in marriage,

00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:27.837
right?

00:44:30.236 --> 00:44:33.116
Principles are just packaging.

00:44:33.196 --> 00:44:34.116
Empty words.

00:44:34.997 --> 00:44:35.997
In the end,

00:44:36.116 --> 00:44:37.516
a happy ending

00:44:38.116 --> 00:44:39.236
is what truly matters.

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:40.397
Right?

00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:46.837
Stop worrying about others' problems.

00:44:46.837 --> 00:44:47.556
Okay?

00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:48.917
Think about me.

00:44:51.076 --> 00:44:51.556
Look.

00:44:54.556 --> 00:44:55.957
Yuanhang Fund.

00:44:56.596 --> 00:44:57.957
Jiang Liang and Jiang Yun

00:44:58.516 --> 00:45:00.076
(Yuanhang Fund)
will return to China next week.

00:45:00.917 --> 00:45:02.036
I've invited them

00:45:02.196 --> 00:45:03.596
to Jinda Group's reception.

00:45:06.716 --> 00:45:08.516
You need to help me prepare in advance

00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:11.397
to impress

00:45:11.504 --> 00:45:12.236
(Jiang Yun, Chairwoman)

00:45:12.236 --> 00:45:13.477
Jiang Yun.

00:45:20.116 --> 00:45:21.116
Look at her profile.

00:45:22.757 --> 00:45:24.596
Thirty-five years old.

00:45:25.236 --> 00:45:27.076
Calm,

00:45:27.716 --> 00:45:30.116
decisive.

00:45:43.952 --> 00:45:45.968
(Mr. Huang's calling)

00:45:47.076 --> 00:45:47.556
Hello?

00:45:48.116 --> 00:45:49.716
The New District project isn't getting

00:45:49.716 --> 00:45:50.957
your father's support now.

00:45:51.076 --> 00:45:51.877
We must find

00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:54.317
a fund company as backup.

00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:56.076
Jiang Liang and Jiang Yun

00:45:56.196 --> 00:45:57.596
are both back.

00:45:57.917 --> 00:45:59.636
Perfect chance

00:45:59.676 --> 00:46:00.556
to meet them.

00:46:01.036 --> 00:46:01.636
However,

00:46:01.757 --> 00:46:03.676
they're famously tough.

00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:04.957
Jiang Yun

00:46:05.676 --> 00:46:06.516
is calm,

00:46:06.716 --> 00:46:07.997
decisive in actions,

00:46:08.397 --> 00:46:10.236
and has a bad temper.

00:46:10.797 --> 00:46:11.917
(Jiang Yun, Chairwoman)
Known as

00:46:11.957 --> 00:46:13.277
the "Black Rose" of investing.

00:46:13.997 --> 00:46:14.676
Jiang Liang.

00:46:15.317 --> 00:46:17.877
Don't be fooled by the playboy look.

00:46:18.277 --> 00:46:19.757
He's meticulous-minded,

00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:21.397
(Jiang Liang, Deputy Manager)
a numbers genius.

00:46:21.676 --> 00:46:23.516
Key to Yuanhang Fund's finance.

00:46:23.997 --> 00:46:26.156
Rumor says he has a photographic memory.

00:46:27.156 --> 00:46:28.716
This is all I can help you.

00:46:29.397 --> 00:46:30.757
The rest is up to you.

00:46:31.116 --> 00:46:32.076
