WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.288
It’s not over yet.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.112
Don’t think it’s a happy ending.

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:04.768
Should we pick some cards?

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:06.770
The truth is about to be revealed.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.224
Karn.

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:09.904
You’re incredible, my friend.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.736
You’re the nephew of the hospital owner.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:13.368
Why doesn’t he choose you?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.584
Thap, you bastard!

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.984
Why did you do it?

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:19.200
Why?!

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.904
What did you see, In?

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:22.104
The guy named Karn.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Get him!

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.744
Karn!

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.544
It’s all over.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.784
I’ll be right here with you,
not going anywhere.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.760
That fate would bring someone into my life

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:46.080
and change everything I believed…

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.480
(I would have told them to get lost back then.)

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.584
(But now, I believe it with all my heart.)

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.072
Morning, In.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.960
Morning, Thap.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.576
Get up.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
I’ve got an early meeting.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.440
I’m not letting you go.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.664
What’s going on?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.152
Why so clingy today?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.136
I’m lonely.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.020
Lonely?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.416
Then hold on a sec.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.280
What are you doing, Thap?

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.600
Typing up my resignation letter.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.390
Reason: my boyfriend feels lonely.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.616
Oh, come on, Thap.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:01.928
I was just joking.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.216
Don’t go overboard, Doctor.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580
Yeah?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Mhm.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.000
(In this world, many things
can be proven with evidence.)

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:20.384
(But some things don’t need proof

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.230
(because we’d rather not have one.)

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.080
(When it unfolds right before your eyes,
you decide in an instant, with your heart.)

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120
Thap.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.200
You said you’d stay home today.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.296
Just stopping by to bring you something.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.240
Here’s your snack.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Here.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.144
Thank you, boyfriend.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.664
What about me?

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.870
Hm?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.336
Don’t I get a kiss too?

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.272
Hey, Mr. In.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.640
You can’t be jealous of a drink bottle.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.060
It’s tasty.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.370
You mean me?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.540
I mean the drink.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.050
It’s refreshing too.

00:05:20.544 --> 00:05:22.540
Gosh. I’m leaving.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.512
Wait, wait!

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.640
What?

00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:30.672
Thap.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.216
I was kidding.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.240
Your cheeks are
the most refreshing thing in the world.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.096
Let me have some.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.648
Refreshing, indeed.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240
Right?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.256
Ow, In!

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:58.536
It’s cold.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.608
- Thap.
- Time for your punishment.

00:06:02.648 --> 00:06:03.648
What are you doing?

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:05.320
Is it cold?

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:06.352
Is it cold now?

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.970
Hey, Thap.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.648
Hi, In.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.360
You came to a hospital. Are you a patient?

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.784
No, I’m a doctor’s boyfriend.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.700
Nice.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.728
Hey, you came to a hospital.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.416
Are you a patient?

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440
I’m a cop.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.800
You dumbass.

00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:27.528
What?

00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:28.760
What am I supposed to say?

00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:30.312
“I’m a doctor’s boyfriend.”

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:31.328
Ah!

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.104
Should I walk in again?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320
Just forget it.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.540
I’m used to it.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.240
Pong, he’s so dumb.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.616
Should I get you a new boyfriend?

00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:42.712
Thap, you asshole.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.584
No need. I’m fine with this one.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.760
He’s pretty dense. I like it.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.960
Go on. Have a seat.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
Hey, Thap.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.648
What did the director say?

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:02.056
What could he say?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.544
“My nephew's a good kid”?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.144
He wanted to resign to take responsibility,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.344
but the board wouldn’t let him.

00:07:09.392 --> 00:07:13.600
Didn’t Karn talk to his uncle about
why he wasn’t made Deputy Director?

00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:15.088
He’s the only nephew.

00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:17.592
Of course, his uncle
was going to make him Director.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.000
That’s f*cked up.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.784
What was the point of doing all that then?

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:27.840
I think he tried to be a friend
the best he could.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.440
And then he met a scumbag like Kasidis,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.190
and everything went to hell.

00:07:33.592 --> 00:07:35.264
Oh, hey, In.

00:07:37.744 --> 00:07:39.120
I need a favor.

00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:40.200
What is it?

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.620
Can you give me a reading
on a case I’m working on?

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.344
I’m completely lost.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360
Hey.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
No way.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.096
Thap, don’t be stingy.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.616
I’ve been completely booked lately…

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.936
by just one person, though.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.576
He got all my time.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.976
Aw!

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.980
Jackass!

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:08.008
Oh, Thap.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.280
When are you going to visit Karn?

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:37.592
Does it hurt?

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:47.712
How could you do that?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.136
We’re friends, and I always trusted you.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.168
People suspected you,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.168
but I didn’t think it was true.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Enough.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.768
Aren’t we your friends?

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.168
You’re a doctor.

00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:15.940
You can’t talk to a patient like this.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.824
Don’t make me warn you again,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.720
Dr. Pokpong.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720
Let’s go.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980
How is he?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.584
You should see for yourself.

00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:04.408
Ouch.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.904
Why did you help me?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.448
Because you’re my friend.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.752
Play the hero somewhere else.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.976
I really want to know this, Karn.

00:10:44.384 --> 00:10:46.380
When did you start hating me this much?

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.760
I’m so damn mad at you, you know?

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.360
So f*cking mad.

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:10.100
What kind of lousy friend
does things like this?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.752
And your reason?

00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:17.096
Gosh, it’s ridiculous.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.888
Any reason sounds ridiculous to you.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.160
Who would be as perfect as you?

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.200
You get what you want.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.256
The one who gets what he wants is you.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.930
Not me.

00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:50.368
Don’t think you’re the only one
with drama in life, Karn.

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:56.176
Get out.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.040
Get out.

00:12:04.648 --> 00:12:06.976
I didn’t even want to come here.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.496
Burn that into your head.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.824
Cutting ties with you
would’ve been a hundred times easier.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.576
But the word ‘friend’ is…

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.504
Don’t call me your friend.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.880
Friends…

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.224
don’t kill each other.

00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:19.992
Did I die, though?

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.160
Damn, your mouth.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.992
I’m sorry.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.030
I’m sorry.

00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:28.970
Hey, I need to ask you something.

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:32.500
Why did you disappear on me back then?

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.440
I was heartbroken.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.940
Heartbroken?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.760
From who?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.880
From you—duh!

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.128
You were the only one I liked.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.104
Who would’ve thought you liked me?

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.608
Thought you were
too embarrassed by people’s teasing.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.784
I was never embarrassed.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.088
And I really wanted to become
a police officer because you said you liked it.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.440
But once I got in,
you were the one who disappeared.

00:15:11.568 --> 00:15:13.440
I’m… sorry.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.200
You really are a police officer now.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.450
Well done.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Can I…

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.264
leave this with you then?

00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:46.260
I’m forgetful. I don’t want to lose it.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720
That hand.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.416
Don’t think I don’t know…

00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:06.792
what this means.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.944
I know you do. That’s why I left it with you.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.992
Do you want to keep it?

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.384
Once it’s mine, you won’t get it back.

00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:31.768
Hey.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.992
Can’t I touch you at all?

00:16:35.592 --> 00:16:36.592
Why?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.860
In.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.180
Hm?

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:54.810
What?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.096
I think I’ve got the answer.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.952
Remember when you asked me
what I’d want to be if I could choose?

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.552
I want to be a doctor, but…

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.712
There’s a ‘but’?

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:21.008
Back then, I thought
being a doctor was my dad’s dream.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.360
Until you asked me.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.184
That’s when I realized…

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.400
being a doctor was my dream too.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.160
How are they different?

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.660
Oh, they’re different, In.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.800
No one wants to
chase someone else’s dream.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400
Right?

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.750
Don’t you want to
patch things up with your dad?

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.000
I never asked about
the conflict between you two.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.352
Honestly, I’ve never really known
what the real problem was.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.952
All I know is that
I was always carrying his expectations.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.880
And one day,
I guess I just couldn’t bear it anymore.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.368
Where are you going?

00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:23.460
May I go to the bathroom?

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.648
Can I go on a beach trip with my friends?

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.640
Is it so necessary?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.232
Thap, do you still want to be a doctor?

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.112
I do.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.376
Then you shouldn’t
waste your time on unnecessary things.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560
Yes, sir.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.776
Still want to go?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.584
Not anymore.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.104
So, what about when you were dating Wan?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.912
If I told you, would you be upset?

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.176
No. Just tell me.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.620
Are you sure?

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420
Mm.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.130
Okay.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.960
When I was with Wan…

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.440
my dad was quite uptight

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.792
because we met
while I was studying so hard,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.920
and Dad was worried I’d lose focus.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.224
So bad that you two didn’t talk?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.360
I didn’t know what to talk to him about.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.232
Talk to him, Thap.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.540
Don’t wait until
you’re in the same situation as me.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.992
No matter how much

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.576
I want to talk to my dad now,

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.376
You called for a consult or what?

00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:22.584
As someone who has
a fortune-teller boyfriend,

00:20:22.608 --> 00:20:23.608
can you help me?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.128
With what?

00:20:25.152 --> 00:20:25.936
See?

00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:27.800
You got the Death card.

00:20:27.856 --> 00:20:29.800
You can’t go through the surgery.

00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:32.136
We can clearly see it’s bad here.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.600
You can undergo the surgery.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.000
I’m the one operating, not the card.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
Hello.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.672
How are you today?

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.584
Not doing so well.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.208
The Death card
doesn’t always mean something bad.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.056
And look at the other two:
Temperance and The Star.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.656
Together, they mean one thing ends,

00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:03.070
and another has a fresh start.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:10.544
I think what the cards say
matches what Dr. Pokpong says.

00:21:10.568 --> 00:21:11.672
Really?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.540
Thanks a lot.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.300
What’s up, Dao?

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.288
Dad said that?

00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:35.384
Thap.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.232
Maybe another time.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.176
Hey.

00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:43.824
Thap.

00:21:43.848 --> 00:21:45.016
What are you doing?

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.496
You can’t leave.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.376
My dad invited you here for a meal.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800
Are we really doing this?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.304
In, what are you afraid of?

00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:56.336
Hm?

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.160
You’ve visited my house before.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.544
It’s not the same.

00:22:01.584 --> 00:22:04.768
I came as a friend back then,
but now I’m coming as your boy…

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.360
Get it out, Mr. Inthu.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.848
Please say it out loud.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.712
As your boyfriend.

00:22:29.744 --> 00:22:31.552
Aw.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.616
You’re making me blush.

00:22:40.528 --> 00:22:42.530
It’s not funny, Thap.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.816
In, what are you afraid of?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.816
I’m nervous.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.160
You should get used to this.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.512
Because soon we will be family.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.392
I’ve chosen you.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.384
I’m never gonna change my mind.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.064
Me neither.

00:23:06.104 --> 00:23:08.768
I’ve pinned you down since the day we met.

00:23:08.952 --> 00:23:10.770
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

00:23:10.816 --> 00:23:16.544
I knew it from day one
that you could take care of Thap.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.056
Thank you so much, sweetheart,
for looking after him.

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.808
It’s my pleasure.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.992
From now on,
you’re not on your own anymore.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.056
Think of us as your family.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.170
Yes, ma’am.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.120
How lovely.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.784
I’m gonna go check
if the dining table is all set.

00:23:57.808 --> 00:23:59.752
And then we’ll eat.

00:23:59.784 --> 00:24:01.750
Dao, come help. Come on.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.560
While we wait,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.260
would you like to
check out the plants with me, In?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.568
This tree is very beautiful,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.328
though it’s a shame
this branch sticks out at a weird angle.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.912
- Mrs. Thappee.
- Yes?

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.104
I can’t tell, sir.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.928
I think it’s already gorgeous.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.992
Maybe if its angle changed,

00:25:01.184 --> 00:25:03.180
it wouldn’t have the same charm,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.024
or we might not appreciate it as much.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.300
Right, sir?

00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:23.472
That’s true.

00:25:25.808 --> 00:25:28.784
Thanks a lot, In, for taking care of Thap.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.456
It’s Thap who takes care of me.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.000
Thank you and Mrs. Thepee so much
for raising him so well.

00:25:39.936 --> 00:25:41.940
So well his kindness reaches me too.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.984
Thap is stubborn.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.592
Sometimes he can be a little blunt.

00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:57.552
He’s actually very gentle.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400
Like his mom.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.928
More like his dad.

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:15.530
You plant trees.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.024
If you didn’t have calm, gentle hands,

00:26:20.824 --> 00:26:22.820
you couldn’t grow so many.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.928
Eloquent one, aren’t you?

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.992
I’ve had this one since Thap was young.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.504
It’s grown alongside him.

00:26:42.192 --> 00:26:43.960
Food is ready.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.480
Geez.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.960
Seems like we’re out of favor soon.

00:27:02.992 --> 00:27:05.112
We’re in the doghouse for sure.

00:27:06.672 --> 00:27:08.200
All heritage is divided by four.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.568
Alright, guys.

00:27:12.608 --> 00:27:15.528
The food is ready. Let’s go eat.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.768
Come.

00:27:16.808 --> 00:27:18.296
Honey, come on.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.144
Let’s go, Thap.

00:27:20.176 --> 00:27:22.140
Divided by four, she said?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.336
Hold on a second.

00:27:26.376 --> 00:27:27.376
Hm?

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.360
I left my brother with you for a short while,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.360
and now he’s all yours.

00:27:32.424 --> 00:27:35.176
Damn, how much heritage
will I even have left?

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.024
Serves you right.

00:27:36.048 --> 00:27:37.310
I’m gonna take it all.

00:27:37.472 --> 00:27:39.310
You’re wicked.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.080
Hey, Dao.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.720
Are you okay with this?

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.744
More than okay.

00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:49.120
I’m so glad.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.300
Do you think
your mom and dad are okay with it too?

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.936
It’s a modern world,
and the law’s been around for a while.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:00.536
Who knows? Thap might
ask you to marry him next month.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.208
Oh, please.

00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:03.800
I’m not in a rush.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.160
You’d better hurry
before my brother ends up bedridden.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.528
He’s not even that old.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.888
His mouth might get him there.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920
Oh, you have a point

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.776
Let’s go eat.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.530
All right.

00:28:27.128 --> 00:28:28.128
In…

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.896
Why don’t you spend the night here?

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.460
Don’t you want to stay with me?

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.872
I’m standing right here, you know?

00:28:39.232 --> 00:28:41.230
Gosh, I’m not used to you like this.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.736
That’s your problem.

00:28:45.216 --> 00:28:47.000
Why don’t you let me drive you home?

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.208
If I do, you’ll just crash at my place.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.840
Fair enough.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.400
Because I want to spend time with you.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.576
That’s enough.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.870
Enough already.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.744
Gosh.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.736
I should let Dao send me home.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.256
I want you to talk to your dad.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.088
I think he wants to talk to you too.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840
Okay.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.536
Drive safe.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.940
Mm.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.168
Don’t be a whiny baby.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.152
Let’s go already.

00:30:20.464 --> 00:30:22.460
Have I been too hard on you, son?

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.752
Why would you ask that?

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:37.870
I don’t know.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.576
Sometimes I wonder if what I did…

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.664
was too much for you.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.184
You’re the eldest, and I was a first-time dad.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.208
I don’t know if I’ve been too harsh.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.272
Honestly…

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.008
yes.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.176
But I don’t know how I’d have made it this far

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.384
without you.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.704
Do you know…

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.784
you never cried for me when you were little?

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:46.750
You only cried and asked for your mom.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.792
I think, deep down,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.824
I was afraid you wouldn’t love me.

00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:06.610
But every time
I was uncertain about something,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.432
you were the one I thought of.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.008
I’m sorry, son, for being too strict on you.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.016
You don’t have to apologize.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.784
I’m okay.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:06.408
Do you know that you’re never “not okay”?

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.816
You never show weakness to anyone,

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.496
even to your own family.

00:33:27.584 --> 00:33:31.448
I think it’s like flunking an exam.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.320
I know you wouldn’t want me to flunk.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.792
I was too harsh, indeed.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:55.696
You know, even your mom is afraid
to talk to me about this.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.848
But today, In mentioned it.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.760
He did?

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.260
Dad.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.176
Are you okay with In?

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.736
Of course, I am.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.768
Are you happy?

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960
Very much.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.552
That’s all your mom and I want.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.380
So…

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
I…

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.136
I have your permission, right, Dad?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.832
From now on, whatever problem I have,

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.480
you’re the first person I’ll come to, crying.

00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:38.384
Be there for me.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120
Sure.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.360
Definitely.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.392
I’ll always be here for you.

00:36:29.568 --> 00:36:31.570
Why don’t you sleep at home?

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.640
I have a boyfriend.

00:36:33.688 --> 00:36:34.992
I don’t want to sleep alone.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.168
Did you talk to your dad?

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.984
I did.

00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.024
Yeah?

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.744
How was it?

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.350
Great.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.408
See?

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.528
I told you it was a good idea to talk.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.160
You and your dad are so much alike.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.040
You should understand each other well.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.896
Besides, you just like to act tough.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.528
THAPFAH

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.740
Thap?

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.984
Be with me forever,

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.690
In.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.040
INTHU

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.904
What do you say?

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.744
Be together forever.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.768
This card means happiness, completion,

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.728
closure, and freedom.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.920
Something along those lines.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.140
Yeah?

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.200
Mm.

00:39:27.912 --> 00:39:29.056
The World.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.064
What if I think about love and draw this card?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.752
Does it mean my love is complete?

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.728
That works too.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.232
It really is complete.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.832
Yes, Yam?

00:40:22.376 --> 00:40:24.380
Sure, I can talk.

00:40:27.248 --> 00:40:29.250
You’re writing a new column?

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.208
Ah.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.520
Yes, I’ve got time.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.520
How frequently do you want it?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.272
Monthly or weekly?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080
Ah.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.360
Ow. Thap.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.784
Nothing, Yam.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.936
Yes, I’m free to talk.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.800
Yes, sure.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.976
Uh…

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.090
Let me…

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.160
Let me call you back.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.352
I need…

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.768
I need to poop!

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:26.888
Damn it, Thap!

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.424
Yes, my dear In?

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:37.550
Fine.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.080
No more card reading.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.312
And are you even fully recovered?

00:41:42.336 --> 00:41:43.336
Oh, gosh.

00:41:48.568 --> 00:41:50.192
Absolutely recovered.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.016
What are you going to do to me, boyfriend?

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.520
Don’t think so.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.240
Let’s check out more cards.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.808
Thap!

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.150
What?

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.290
In.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.184
I barely get to stay home.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.160
Thap.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.800
(Some say humans need someone different
to feel complete.)

00:43:01.856 --> 00:43:06.304
(That way, love becomes whole.)

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.952
(The old me
wouldn’t have believed it for a second.)

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.568
(But today, when we love someone,
no matter how different our beliefs,

00:43:16.608 --> 00:43:19.936
(we always find a way
to adjust and keep going.)

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:24.944
(Because nothing is better than
a chance to see each other every day.)

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.904
(True love not only brings us happiness,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:37.024
(but also opens our hearts, letting us see joy
in ways we never imagined.)

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.808
(Beliefs are understood only by the heart.)

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:51.780
(Like the teaching, “And now
these three remain: faith, hope, and love.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.384
(But the greatest of these is love.”)

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.720
Which bedroom are you giving me this time?

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:14.632
You want a separate room?

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.216
No way.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.728
Do you still have visions
or bad dreams these days?

00:44:52.136 --> 00:44:53.304
Not really.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.776
No bad dreams.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.120
And I hardly see visions anymore.

00:45:00.672 --> 00:45:02.670
I think my mind is stronger now.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.168
Must be because of me.

00:45:07.664 --> 00:45:09.170
Gosh.

00:45:09.288 --> 00:45:11.170
Leave some room for me to compliment you.

00:45:11.904 --> 00:45:13.900
I said it on your behalf.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.552
Back then, when you suggested
we hold hands whenever I felt low,

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.000
it helped a lot.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.968
We can hold hands when we’re happy too.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.008
We can always do.

00:45:36.648 --> 00:45:38.216
I won’t let go then.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.616
By all means.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.472
I’m never letting go either.

00:45:46.576 --> 00:45:48.696
Tomorrow is your parents’ death anniversary.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.384
Let’s go see them together.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.272
I apologize for introducing myself a bit late.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.976
My name is Thap.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.776
Dr. Thapfah Kittipokin.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.980
I’m the older brother of In’s best friend,

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:26.880
the one In loves,

00:46:28.248 --> 00:46:30.250
and loves In deeply.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.976
All this time,
you must have been so worried about him.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:41.216
I’d like you to know
that you can rest assured

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.384
There’s nothing to worry about.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.760
I will take care of In.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.104
In is a lot stronger now.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.296
He eats more vegetables,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.608
and he’s growing taller.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.976
Oh, and he’s back to
playing the guitar, ma’am.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.040
One more thing,

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.904
I hope you don’t mind that
I fixed your favorite chair.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.900
I promise, sir and ma’am,

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:21.552
I will love In dearly, as a way of
honoring how well you raised him.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:30.824
I came here today to ask for your son’s hand.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.584
I might be a little late,

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.032
but I hope we have your blessings.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840
I promise to…

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:10.032
tell you good morning every morning

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.752
and good night every night.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.152
More importantly,

00:48:20.784 --> 00:48:22.780
I will never let you be lonely again.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.656
You’re making a promise
in front of my parents.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.390
Yeah, I promise.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360
Hey.

00:48:57.416 --> 00:48:59.420
I’ve been meaning to ask.

00:48:59.448 --> 00:49:02.360
I noticed our rings have
both our names carved inside.

00:49:02.768 --> 00:49:04.392
Did you switch them by accident?

00:49:05.824 --> 00:49:06.824
No.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.200
I meant it this way.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.100
Hm?

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:20.608
In belongs to Thap.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.904
And Thap belongs to In?

00:49:26.944 --> 00:49:27.944
That’s right.

00:50:02.464 --> 00:50:04.460
Scene 10/34, Cut 1, Take 1.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.376
Hi.

00:50:06.408 --> 00:50:07.872
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.680
I’m In, short for Inthu.

00:50:09.712 --> 00:50:10.740
I’m a fortune teller.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:12.488
Hi. I’m Thapfah.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.656
I’m a Critical Care doctor
and also In’s fiancé.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.480
Tell us about your first encounter.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.120
How did you feel?

00:50:18.152 --> 00:50:20.192
- He’s definitely my type.
- I despised him so much.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
What did you say?

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.864
I despised you.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.080
You did, huh?

00:50:25.104 --> 00:50:26.659
Come on. In.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.920
Well, it’s true.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.032
I remember the first time you saw me.

00:50:31.056 --> 00:50:32.552
You were captivated.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.080
Yeah, for a split second.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.728
Then you opened your mouth,
and everything became clear.

00:50:39.352 --> 00:50:41.368
When did you start
feeling impressed by the other person?

00:50:41.392 --> 00:50:43.968
I think it was when I got hit by a car,
and In rushed to help.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.784
Of course, he’s impressed.

00:50:46.808 --> 00:50:48.128
Otherwise, he’d be dead.

00:50:48.168 --> 00:50:49.696
Please, In.

00:50:49.712 --> 00:50:53.456
If I’d been dead, you’d have lost
your chance at such a great boyfriend.

00:50:53.496 --> 00:50:58.328
I’m hot, rich, and super caring.
I’m attentive and take you on trips…

00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.970
Let’s leave that part for someone else to say.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:01.472
Yeah?

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.144
Mm.

00:51:02.168 --> 00:51:03.168
I’m sorry.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.888
I was impressed…

00:51:05.904 --> 00:51:08.496
when he helped me after I fainted

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.008
and introduced himself.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.384
“I’m a doctor,” and even struck a little pose.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:15.750
Right?

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.296
Is that right?

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:22.368
Look at him.

00:51:22.408 --> 00:51:24.370
You two talk. Leave me out of it.

00:51:25.088 --> 00:51:26.190
It’s true, though.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:31.848
But I was really touched
when he helped fix my home.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.744
You mean when I helped fix the chair?

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760
Mm.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.096
That hit harder than a car crash.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.392
Can I give a new answer?

00:51:41.424 --> 00:51:43.176
I’m actually most impressed by
his smart mouth.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.280
So impressed.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:47.744
I’ve been waiting to hear that.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.160
Now, let me give you a new answer.

00:51:49.184 --> 00:51:51.896
I like it so much when In faints.

00:51:51.936 --> 00:51:55.672
I’ve never seen anyone faint this often,
like, all the time.

00:51:55.688 --> 00:51:56.784
But it’s good.

00:51:56.808 --> 00:51:58.780
I get to use my medical skills so efficiently.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.936
Lucky me.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.088
Next, who fell first?

00:52:04.128 --> 00:52:05.128
- In!
- Thap!

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.232
You fell first.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.110
You always showed yourself around me.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.784
You drove me home.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.520
You looked after me in the hospital.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.560
Will you deny it?

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.080
That’s true.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.008
What are the best traits of your fiancé?

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.440
He’s a lovely person

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.176
and… very kind.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.160
But what I love most is that…

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.472
he’s so stubborn.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.280
And he always fights me back.

00:52:33.304 --> 00:52:36.768
Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.632
Ah.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.472
Soft, like this?

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.440
But here’s the thing:

00:52:44.488 --> 00:52:47.984
when we’re alone, he spoils me so much.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.240
He’s very good at housework.

00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:52.656
I’m too lazy to do it.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:55.512
So you want a househusband, huh?

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200
Can’t argue with that.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.848
I heard Thap is quite the flirt. Is that true, In?

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.936
It’s so very true.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.664
He flirts constantly, like it’s his full-time job.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.216
He hits on me nonstop.

00:53:07.248 --> 00:53:10.584
Like it’s the last day on earth
and tomorrow he won’t get another chance.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.680
Is that right, Doctor?

00:53:12.704 --> 00:53:13.704
That’s right.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.848
What?

00:53:15.864 --> 00:53:17.984
I don’t like acting sweet just to get someone.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.600
If I like someone, I hit on them.

00:53:21.664 --> 00:53:22.632
I go all in.

00:53:22.672 --> 00:53:25.416
I’ll flirt until they’re mine.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.808
And even when they are, I keep flirting,
so they love only me

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.000
Not an easy trait to find, you know?

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.928
I hope you’ll always be like this.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720
I promise.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.696
This is a digital footprint.

00:53:41.728 --> 00:53:45.472
If I ever stop flirting with him,
you have my permission to expose me.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400
I’m not afraid.

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.000
Alright.

00:53:49.312 --> 00:53:52.176
Do you have any words for your fiancé?

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.624
Actually, I want to tell him so many things.

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.744
Most of all, I love you so much, In.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.376
I love you too, Thap.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.176
Very much.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.416
May I… please interrupt?

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.800
Can you show us your love?

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.312
Right here?

00:54:17.336 --> 00:54:18.336
Yes.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.880
Are you sure?

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.920
I’m sure.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.880
Don’t think that’s a good idea.

00:54:23.912 --> 00:54:24.912
It is.

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:27.552
He’s shy now.

00:54:27.632 --> 00:54:29.000
Are your ears turning red?

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.000
They are.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.920
Look.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:35.368
The camera’s ready over here.

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:56.944
Digital footprint.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160
Cut.
