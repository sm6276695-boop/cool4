00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.440
Ah

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.680
This foreign hairpin

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.880
is really uncomfortable.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.560
The grain transport ship

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.320
will arrive in Hepu tomorrow.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.320
If Ka Na has already resolved

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.680
the grain issue in Nanjun,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.720
then the grain I brought back this time

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.040
will be enough for Hepu's needs for several years.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640
That's wonderful.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.480
This way, Hepu's food crisis

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480
can be resolved.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.240
Zhang He wanted to use grain

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.720
to control the price of pearls,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.160
but his scheme will collapse on its own.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480
Oh, by the way, Rong'er,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.600
I only asked you to go to Jiaozhi for grain,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.480
so why did you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.920
come back as a Pearl Envoy?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.280
In Jiaozhi,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240
I found that the nobles and merchants there

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.320
are very interested in this maritime trade route.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
So they want me to act as an envoy

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.360
to truly open up this trade route.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.600
Maritime trade route.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.360
Sir,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920
when we were drifting at sea before,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.240
Li Ling told me about it.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.640
Hey, Rong'er,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.400
do you think

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.240
if all these goods could be

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
shipped out by sea,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.640
just like

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.800
the migration of sea shells,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.280
then

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.240
we could set up

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.200
a network like the Li family's in the Central Plains,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.040
with trade routes reaching everywhere.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.160
Sounds like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.440
it could work.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.400
If we can sail farther,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.880
then all the boasts I made to Ka Na

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.800
could actually come true.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.960
Things like silk,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.560
porcelain, and cotton could all be sold.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800
We could make a lot of money.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.240
If Ka Na finds out

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.040
you were just bragging and tricked her,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.840
she

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.640
would definitely hang you over the sea to feed the fish.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.360
Just don't tell her, don't tell her.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.240
Maritime trade route.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.040
Ah

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.080
If we open up maritime trade,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.840
we might really be able to establish

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.040
a Maritime Silk Road.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.640
Sir,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.960
let's set aside the maritime trade route for now.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.680
There's a more serious problem now.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.040
Have you noticed

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.960
that through this Pearl God Festival,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.280
although many sea shells were brought in from other counties,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360
which can produce pearls,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.600
the quality

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.560
is much worse than before.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.880
It's far from

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280
the quality of Southern Pearls we used to offer as tribute.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840
Do you think it's possible

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.680
that only in Hepu

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.080
can these sea shells produce the best Southern Pearls?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.360
Fool!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.760
If you hadn't killed Wang Cheng

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.920
so recklessly,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.760
today

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.440
I wouldn't be so humiliated before Meng Chang.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.000
How could I be in such a sorry state?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.720
Ah

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.200
So we still have grain in hand.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.320
We can still hold Meng Chang in check.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.480
But Jiaozhi's grain ships

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.840
will arrive at the port tomorrow.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.560
Once the ships arrive,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.320
Meng Chang will send heavy guards.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.520
The refugee problem

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.160
will be resolved soon.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.560
All our arrangements

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.200
will be wasted.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.080
This is all thanks to your dear husband.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.560
Back then,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.080
I

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.120
should have killed him in prison.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.640
Father,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440
Compared to Li Ling,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.840
I think there's something else

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.080
that might need attention.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.040
Speak.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.080
The female general beside Meng Chang

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.640
hasn't been seen for a long time.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120
What?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.800
Tell the people at Meiling

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.800
to guard the pass for me.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.800
If anything happens,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.880
report immediately.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.200
Did you hear me?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.240
Yes.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.520
I don't care about your Pearl God Festival,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600
win or lose.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.000
Keep a close eye on Li Ling.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.520
I need time

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.520
to bring my private troops into the city.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.720
Understand?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.360
Yes.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.000
I also want to settle things with Li Ling

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.200
once and for all.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.280
Meng Chang,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.680
Li Ling,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.800
I want you to know

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.800
that I, Zhang He,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.840
am the true ruler of Hepu.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.240
None of you will leave alive.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.640
No one will leave alive.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.640
My own bed is still the most comfortable.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.360
Li Ling,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.800
do you know how much we earned today?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
So much, I can't even count it.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.720
Your method of taking half and compensating half

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.760
not only didn't lose, but made a profit.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.440
We were supposed to lose,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.000
but after your move,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.120
regardless of the outcome,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.840
I won everything.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.800
Was this your plan all along?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.320
Ha, no.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.000
You're just too clever.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.080
I want to have a child like you,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.760
smart and capable.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.480
Don't be impulsive.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.040
Don't let money cloud your mind.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.600
Hey, listen to me.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.360
I still have Jia Rong'er.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.360
Fainted.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.640
He fainted.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040
I'm so angry.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.040
Ah!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.000
Sister,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.800
See, I told you so.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.640
This method definitely won't work.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.400
Li Gongzi isn't that kind of person.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.920
If I weren't afraid I'd never return from Jiaozhi,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.920
I wouldn't have agreed to her.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.600
I hereby announce

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.680
the Pearl God Festival's

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.240
final contest

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000
begins now.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.560
Husband, please go first.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.120
How about this:

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.880
Let's decide the winner with one shell.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.800
How about it?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.440
You can play however you want today.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.600
I'll accompany you to the end.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.680
You truly have extraordinary abilities.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.800
So you also value this shell.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.680
Then I'll let you have it.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.640
If you like it,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.320
I'll give it to you.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.160
Then I'll accept it.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.200
Come.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.600
Get ready to open the shell.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.880
This is

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.880
This must be the finest pearl found in recent years.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.720
Golden Pearl

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.480
It's a Golden Pearl.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.160
It could easily be called the king of Tribute Pearls.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.640
I've never seen such a fine pearl.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.960
This shape,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.360
this luster,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.200
My husband,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.400
Thank you for letting me win.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.240
The outcome is decided.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.720
Miss Zhang,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.000
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.040
Can you possibly reveal

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.240
a pearl better than this one?

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.120
Just admit defeat to your wife.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.280
The Pearl God title always goes to your family anyway.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
That's right.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.000
Exactly.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.600
Young Master Li,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.640
It's your turn.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.840
Please open the shell.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.280
Wow

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.400
It's a divine pearl.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.480
I've never seen such a beautiful pearl.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.560
So beautiful.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.040
Purple is the most precious.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.120
Its glow is natural.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.840
Purple is the most precious.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200
Its glow is natural.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.400
We meet again.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.880
Pearl King

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:54.600
Pearl God

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.840
Everyone, disperse.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.280
Ah, my good son-in-law.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.680
You are the very first in history

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.200
Pearl God.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000
Ah!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.760
What nonsense Pearl God!

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.240
It's just a way to exploit the people.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.880
Today, in the name of Pearl God,

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.960
I will destroy this Pearl God's hall.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.640
Li Ling

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.920
What are you doing?

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.520
Li Ling, you're courting death!

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.680
Guards!

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.920
Cut him down!

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.520
All unrelated people

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.600
must leave at once.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.000
It's Lord Meng.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.960
There is an imperial decree.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
Kneel.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.720
Obey Heaven and follow the times.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.200
Imperial edict issued.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.080
Hereby,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.200
I have heard of strange events in Hepu.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.320
Rumors have spread

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.680
that Hepu pearls do not go beyond Meiling.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.200
If they do, they turn to dust.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.800
Some even say

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.440
it's the will of the sea god.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.480
Such words are utterly absurd.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.240
Meng Chang is now appointed envoy.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.000
Commander of the Imperial Guard, Wang Qiang,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.800
will escort the Tribute Pearls to the capital.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.360
Zhang He, Prefect of Hepu, has failed in his duties.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.720
He colluded with powerful families,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.960
formed factions for personal gain,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.320
deceived superiors and subordinates,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.760
and harmed the people.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.080
Upon receipt of this decree,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.680
he is stripped of his office,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.480
and escorted to the capital for trial.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.080
Meng Chang will temporarily assume the position of Hepu Prefect.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.640
By imperial command.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.360
Everyone else, withdraw.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.880
Zhang He receives the decree.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.760
Zhang He

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.320
receives the decree.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.920
What is it?

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.280
Are you defying the imperial decree?
