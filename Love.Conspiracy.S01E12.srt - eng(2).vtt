00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.400

This is Bai Xue,
who impersonated Zhizhi in the video.

She is willing to come back
to testify and surrender.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.740
You brought her back?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.860
Of course.

Ms. Bai Xue,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.060
do you know why we asked you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.180
to come back?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.860
I know.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.900
Mr. Ji has already explained it clearly.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.500
I didn't know
things would be so serious at that time.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.180
I was blinded by money for a moment.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.140
They sent me abroad

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.100

Fortunately, Mr. Ji saved me.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.780
Now I am willing to come forward

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.180
to identify the murderer

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.620

Where did you find this bunch of losers?

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.140
Not only did you fail
to get Ji Baijian done,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.860
but you even let him send Bai Xue back.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.460
A bunch of idiots.

Don't you understand what that means?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.820
We underestimated Ji Baijian.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.500

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.340
this is the document I brought back
from abroad.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.700
There's no signature of Song Shan on it.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.140
So what?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.300
Didn't this batch
of rough gemstones still

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.860
stay in his family
for more than ten years?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.580
This just shows

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.420
Song Shan knew these rough gemstones
had an unknown origin

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.820
and he hid it on purpose.

was this document,

and taken away for investigation,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.660
the Song family shouldn't have had
the manpower

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.060

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.900

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.740
why was there lubricating oil

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.140
on the stairs where Xiaofei fell?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.820
It was...

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.340
Mrs. Song who applied the oil
on the stairs.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.220
It was on

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.780
the day Xiaofei fell.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.780
Ms. Song,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.260
it really has nothing to do with me.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.540
I didn't do anything.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.020
I just followed Mrs. Song's request

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.820
to buy the lubricating oil.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.060
I didn't do anything.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.900
Qing,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.420
you're getting more and more daring.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.380
You dare to slander Mrs. Song.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.100
I have evidence.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.460
What are you doing here?

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.420
Xiaofei,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.940
how are your injuries?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.940
You're here to gloat.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.300
Yes.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.740
My future is ruined.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.820
You don't have to pretend to be
a good person here.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.420
I have nothing to say to you.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700
I'm here today

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.460
to talk with you

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.540
and tell you some truths.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.020
Get out.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.700
I don't want to see you.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.020
Whether you want to see me or not,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.700
but I hope you can think carefully.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.940
In this matter,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.300
your leg is so seriously injured,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.380
and I was detained for interrogation.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.020
Who benefited between us?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.420
What exactly do you want to say?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.260
Nie Wenzhi told the police

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.340
that Bai Xue

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.180
was found by your order.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.780
The fake fall

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.500
was also instigated by you.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.420
Now you're gonna take the blame for her.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.700
Impossible.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.740
My mom couldn't do this.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.700
You don't believe it, do you?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.380
It was...

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
Mrs. Song

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.780
who applied lubricating oil
on the stairs.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.420
It was on

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.900
the day Xiaofei fell.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.900
Do you think I'll believe you just
because you randomly found someone

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.940
to record a voice?

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.180
Don't believe it, do you?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.420
Or don't you want to believe it?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.980
Don't you know

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.260
in your own heart
how you fell down the stairs?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.500
Now Bai Xue and Qing have confessed.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.620
Xiaofei,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.380
do you really not know

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.780
why did Nie Wenzhi

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.540
apply lubricating oil on the stairs?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.140
Song Zhizhi,

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.900
what exactly do you want to do?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.260
I've been dependent on my mother
for so many years.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.660
How could she hurt me?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.580
Xiaofei,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.980
do you need me to explain

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.820
what exactly happened in this matter?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.740
Nie Wenzhi asked Qing
to buy lubricating oil,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.860
saying it was for home use,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.220
Qing inadvertently

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.020
saw Nie Wenzhi

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.900
applying lubricating oil on the stairs.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.780
To protect herself,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.740
she recorded this video.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.420
And then you fell,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.020
and then you became like this.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.860

Impossible.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.940
Why? Why would she harm me?

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.620
She's my biological mother.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.700
She can't harm me.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.780
Impossible.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.980
Yes.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.420
This is the biological mother you think.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.820
Do you really know her?

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.620

Impossible!

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.220
Do you know how she and I

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.860
lived in the family all these years?

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.700

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.740
for us to depend on each other?

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.420
She can't treat me like this.

I don't know.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.620
But I know in this report,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.140
it is clearly states

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.820
that the genetic similarity between her
and Yi Wenhan

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.980
is 99%.

you can check it again.

You're just a pawn.

was for her biological son, Yi Wenhan.

can you wake up a bit?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.300
Can you think carefully

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.500
about who truly treats you well?

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.540
How has Dad treated you
since you were a child?

I've always regarded you
as my own biological sister.

I hope you can see the reality clearly.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.500
if I don't tell you these things today,
I will regret it.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.460
I hope to nip this matter in the bud.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.980
Just get to the point.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.420
What do you want?

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.100
So I think

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.180
we need an experienced person

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.020
like Yi Wenhan.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.060
Although Ms. Song is not as experienced

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.620
as Mr. Yi Wenhan,

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.620
but from what I heard
from the plan just now,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.620
I believe Ms. Song is indeed better

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.780
in terms of innovation.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.060
If a company always plays it safe
and stays conservative,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.940
sooner or later
it will be eliminated by the market.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.220
Therefore, I think,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.420
Ms. Song's Brand Marketing Method,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.700
to a great extent,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.380
will reverse the current situation.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.780
This can only
represent your personal opinion.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.540
The company and I

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.860
have been through ups and downs
for more than ten years.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.980
I saw it develop
from a small chain brand

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.180
to what it is today.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.540
As for the person who is more suitable
to represent the company,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.740
I have more say than you.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.820
It seems there are different opinions.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.620
In the end, we will decide by voting.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.100
We will determine the candidate
for the agent

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.900
based on the proportion of shares held

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.540
by the supporters of the candidates.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.160
[Final Voting Result:
Song Zhizhi, Yi Wenhan]

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.900
Now,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.620
Mr. Yi Wenhan wins
by 9 percentage points.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.180
You all have seen it.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.980
Mr. Yi Wenhan is now far ahead.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.580
This is sufficient to show

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.540
shareholders' thoughts and attitudes.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.500
Now that things have come to this,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.740
we don't need to waste any more time.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.700
Let's announce the result directly.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.340
As a shareholder holding 20%
of the shares,

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.380
I support Ms. Song Zhizhi.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.460
Ji Baijian.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.860
Shareholders' meeting
of Starlight Jewelry

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.700
does not welcome outsiders.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.700
Today's meeting belongs
to Ms. Song Zhizhi

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.900
and also to my fiancée.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.500
Also, the shares of Jihong Group
you just mentioned.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.460
Sorry,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.820
when I said I hold 20% of the shares,

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.020
I meant Starlight Jewelry.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.100
His shareholding certificate is valid.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.540
The share ratio is 20%.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.500
I represent Chairman Ye Taiting
of Starlight Jewelry

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.700
to announce his vote.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.300
Given Mr. Yi's past management experience

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.940
and achievements,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.340
Mr. Ye supports Mr. Yi Wenhan

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.660
in acting general manager
of Starlight Jewelry.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.900
With the shares he holds,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.780
he supports Mr. Yi Wenhan.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.700
Mr. Ye

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.060
supports Mr. Yi Wenhan
with 12 percentage points.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.340
Yi Wenhan wins by 1 percentage point.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.380
Let's congratulate Mr. Yi Wenhan.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.340
Stamp.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.060
Stamp!

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.700
Wait a minute.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:45.980
You're here.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.300
After you left yesterday,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.460
I have thought a lot.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.660
Finally, I figured out the ins and outs

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.500
of these matters.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.980
I know

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.260
if I don't come here today,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.180
I'll regret it all my life.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.020
I'm here today as a shareholder

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.420
to exercise my rights.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.740
I can do it.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.340
I believe everyone has recently

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.660
heard about my scandal.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.340
I'm here today,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.740
in addition to voting,

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.580
and I still want to tell everyone

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.900
to expose the true face of a woman.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.340
Nie Wenzhi,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.740
my mom.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.300
She made me pretend to be pushed down
the stairs by Song Zhizhi

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.380
creating an accident and framing her.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.700
But in fact,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.820
Song Zhizhi didn't push me
at all that night.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.900
Originally, our plan
could have been completed easily.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.500
But unexpectedly,

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.580
my mother

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.620
actually applied lubricating oil
all over the stairs herself.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.980
I guess

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.100
it's because she had already sensed

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.420
that I didn't want to be controlled
by her anymore

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.740
and to do things against my will.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.700
So tell me,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.780
is all this true?

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.780
Mom.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.940
Nie Xiaofei, are you crazy?

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.380
Did you hurt your head?

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.020
You come here and talk nonsense!

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.740
Get out of here.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.140
Let her speak.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.340
There are more ridiculous things.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.700
My mother

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.420
is not my mom at all.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.300
The appraisal report shows

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.420
that I have no parent-child relationship
with her at all.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.020
Her real child

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.260
is Yi Wenhan.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.980
So today's shareholder meeting

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.700
is used by her to seize power

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.460
for her real child.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.260
Xiaofei,

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.340
don't talk nonsense.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.260
So many years,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.580
I've done a lot of things wrong.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.580
Although sometimes
I was bewitched and used.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.380
But wrong is wrong.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.540
I'm sorry

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:27.900
for my previous mistakes.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.500
I don't expect everyone to forgive me,

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.340
But today I dare to say it,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.940
I have a clear conscience.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.540
In my life,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.740
when I was most confused and helpless,

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.900
Song Zhizhi helped me
regardless of past grudges.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.940
She let me know

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.380
my own life

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.740
shouldn't be controlled by others.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.820
So I'd rather give up everything

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.620
to be a decent person.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.300
I decide

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.900
to use my 2% equity

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.860
to support my sister,

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.140
