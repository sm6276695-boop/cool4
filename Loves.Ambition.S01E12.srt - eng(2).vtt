- Hello.
- Hello.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.171
Long time no see.

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.690
Long time no see.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.811
Ms. Jiang,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.368
thank you for the support
in the first half of the year.

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:14.051
Let me toast to you.

00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:16.771
Ms. Jiang.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.410
Hello,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.410
I'm Fang Lei.

00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:27.211
I'll make time to attend
the year-end gala.

00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:29.771
That would be greatly appreciated.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:39.130
Mr. Jiang.

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:44.771
Fang Lei?

00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:46.850
Long time no see.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.130
When did you return?

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:51.130
I've been back for a while.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.971
I've been meaning to visit you.

00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:55.450
But my father said

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.091
you're mostly in New York now,

00:02:57.371 --> 00:02:58.771
rarely spending time in Jingzhou.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.570
I was busy earlier,

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:03.931
but recently,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.410
my work has stabilized.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.931
Let's catch up when free.

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:09.771
Sure.

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:17.850
Excuse me.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.730
Do you have tomato sauce and honey?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.880
What are these for?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.570
Tomato juice

00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:29.771
mixed with honey.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.811
It helps with hangovers.

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:34.570
Does it work?

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:36.211
I've tried it before.

00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:42.051
Let's go. We're late.

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:42.811
Wait.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.730
Going to Maggie's later,
we'll both get drunk for sure.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.531
This is my secret hangover remedy.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.730
What is this?

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:53.771
Tomato sauce mixed with honey.
Family recipe. Try it.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.531
- Does it work?
- Of course.

00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:57.371
Hurry.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.816
Don't leave until you drink it.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.010
Really?

00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:15.570
You are sure to drink a lot

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.850
at today's social gathering.

00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:21.771
What if I get drunk?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.144
I'll take care of you.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.730
You said it.

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:38.490
I'd feel bad.

00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.290
I can do it myself.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.091
No worries.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.490
Many guys are careless these days.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:47.088
Are you free later?

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:48.651
Yes.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.331
What do you want?

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:52.816
Let me introduce you to some friends.

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.810
Great. It's my honor.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.610
Mr. Jiang,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.091
hurry up. We've been waiting.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.410
Got it.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.571
Have some food first.

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:05.771
Come find me later.

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:12.691
Make yourself a drink too.

00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:15.728
I'll be waiting for you.

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:27.971
What are you doing here?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.211
I'm part of the New District project.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.610
And my father has ties
with the Jiang family.

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:36.891
I've known Jiang Liang for years.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.531
I can be helpful here.

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:43.730
Through this approach?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.050
You think I'm embarrassing?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.451
There are just too many people

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.490
flocking to Jiang Liang to flatter him.

00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.490
He knows they want something

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:01.771
and has got used to being fawned over.

00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:03.571
He doesn't even care.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.490
But my status differs from theirs.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.451
By showing humility,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.011
I become more valuable to him.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.771
What you offer him

00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.011
is just emotional validation.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.691
He'll only think of you for fun,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.571
but no real business collaboration.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.490
I'm not that ambitious.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.131
I just want to help our project.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.810
Even a bit more goodwill helps.

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:38.490
Being a decoration or backdrop

00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:40.250
is fine by me.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.370
Don't worry about me.

00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:44.131
I'm doing this willingly.

00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:52.971
I'll head over now.

00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:18.331
How've you been, Ms. Jiang?

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.971
- I'm doing great.
- Sis.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.451
Next time, let me visit your father.
It's been a long time.

00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:28.131
And my father also misses you a lot.

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:29.410
Mr. Shen.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.571
I'll leave you two to chat.

00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:32.011
Okay.

00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:34.691
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.930
I'm Shen Haoming from Jinda Group.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.840
Nice to meet you.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.011
I've long heard of you.
Nice to meet you.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.490
- This is one solution.
- Exactly.

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:45.490
It's jammed.

00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:45.891
Jammed.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.331
Come on.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.971
Excuse me.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.730
Haoming.

00:07:58.771 --> 00:07:59.376
You're here.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.971
- Sorry, I'm late.
- It's okay.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.691
My wife,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.250
Xu Yan.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.810
Hello.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.451
Ms. Jiang from Yuanhang Fund.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.331
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.290
I'm Xu Yan.

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.050
Miss Xu, nice to meet you.

00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:14.011
You two continue. I've got a call.

00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:14.531
Okay.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.091
The fieldwork ran late today.

00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.571
I didn't have time to change.
Sorry for the improper attire.

00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:27.211
This vest is practical.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.370
It holds many essentials.

00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:30.960
Windproof and waterproof too.

00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.211
Fieldwork fears
unpredictable weather most.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.250
Once the equipment is affected,

00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:37.811
all efforts are wasted.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.451
You're truly professional.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.691
I always keep things in my vest.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:44.890
Pens,

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:49.171
spare camera batteries,

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.490
my phone,

00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:53.130
and voice recorder.

00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:54.331
- Xu Yan.
- Lots of things.

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:56.411
There's a dance later.

00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:59.130
Your current outfit isn't appropriate.

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:01.171
Go to my lounge.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.931
I have spare outfits there.

00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:04.850
Is this okay?

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:06.171
Absolutely.

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:07.890
Thank you so much.

00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:10.370
- Let's go.
- This way?

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.130
I think my clothes should fit you.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:15.610
Definitely.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.331
Ms. Jiang.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.650
Thank you.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.571
It's beautiful.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.051
That necklace suits you too.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.411
Formal wear never feels like me.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.010
It's not like uniforms, comfy,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.331
not tight, and fells free.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.171
Don't just stand. Have a seat.

00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:50.691
Thanks.

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.250
Mr. Shen is fortunate

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.291
to have such a beautiful wife like you.

00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:00.650
You handle work well

00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.971
and even go with him
to evening banquets.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.610
A true helpmate.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.010
I don't want to be the woman
behind her husband.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.171
Exhaustively supporting him,

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.370
managing his daily life,

00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.010
and handling his company affairs.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.291
I don't think I can manage that.

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.770
But that's how women in our circle live.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.850
Having clawed my way up

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.610
from the bottom,

00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:36.691
I prefer controlling everything myself.

00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.331
It gives me security

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:41.051
rather than making me an appendage.

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:46.890
I remember you once said,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.850
"Be your own ship,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.890
your own lighthouse,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.811
and your own shore."

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.850
When I first read these lines,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.811
I was deeply touched.

00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.850
I can tell
you've researched me thoroughly.

00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:15.130
You know I've stayed single
all these years

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.691
and dislike the dutiful wife narrative.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.291
You showed up in a uniform

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.571
to mirror my reporter days

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.850
and win my favor.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.850
Am I right?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.850
I guess hardly anyone these days

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.091
would wear that kind of vest
for interviews.

00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:46.010
You're right.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.091
That's how it is.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.650
But it's okay.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.370
You succeeded.

00:11:57.171 --> 00:11:58.171
Because just now,

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:02.650
I really saw my past self in you.

00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.571
I brought a gift for you.

00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.096
(Years Like Songs)

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:22.960
(Journalist Photo Collection)

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.130
I found these photos in the archives.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.730
They're quite old.

00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:40.331
When I first started working,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.650
I kept hearing
about your legendary stories.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.370
(Amazing Intangible Heritage)
But you had already left by then.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.250
So,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.650
that's a pity we never met.

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.610
But ever since then,

00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:57.370
you've always been my role model.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.610
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:13.890
If everything just now

00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:15.091
was some kind of act,

00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:17.770
I want you to know this gift

00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:19.770
is completely genuine.

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:24.091
Thank you.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:26.411
This gift...

00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:28.331
I really like it.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.051
- Come on.
- Cheers!

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.370
Let me introduce, everyone.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.291
She's Fang Lei.
Just returned from abroad.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.691
This is my good friend,

00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:50.610
Chen Heng.

00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:52.691
- Nice to meet you.
- Heng.

00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:56.890
This is also my good friend,

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.411
- Wu Chang.
- Oh, stop it.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.051
Chang.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.451
This is another recent returnee,

00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:05.370
- Wang Hao.
- Hi, Hao.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.770
Bottoms up!

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.530
- Fill it up.
- Top up her glass.

00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:16.931
- Absolutely.
- Great drinking skills.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.691
Yun.

00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:23.250
Kriya, long time no see.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.211
Yeah,

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:25.370
our last meeting

00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:26.890
was two years ago

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:28.130
in New York's Central Park.

00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:30.291
You finally came back.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.931
The domestic opportunities
brought me back.

00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:36.010
About the collaboration we discussed,
we must make it happen this time.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.931
We must sign the contract, okay?

00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:39.931
All the postponed gatherings
must also happen now.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.010
What are you doing?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.411
We're drinking, waiting for you.

00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:48.850
- Come on.
- Let's drink together.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.370
Bottoms up?

00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:50.411
Cheers!

00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:50.931
Come on.

00:14:52.811 --> 00:14:53.971
Am I interrupting?

00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.091
Xu Yan's husband.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.291
Mr. Shen from Jinda Group.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.130
Hello, Mr. Shen.

00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:02.530
Hello.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.472
I've heard so much.

00:15:03.691 --> 00:15:05.010
You go ahead.

00:15:05.051 --> 00:15:05.890
I'll leave now.

00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:11.931
This gown looks stunning.

00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:12.571
Is it?

00:15:13.691 --> 00:15:14.971
Ms. Jiang picked it.

00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:16.931
Without your help, I'd be lost.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.400
I had a great conversation with Xu Yan.
We feel like old friends.

00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:21.171
That's good.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.331
Would Xu Yan have the honor

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.051
to do an exclusive interview with you?

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.571
Consider it her debut opportunity.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.091
What's your angle?

00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:41.091
Typical elite interviews

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.451
just ask successful people

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.610
how they view success.

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.411
But if you accept my interview,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.451
I want to explore

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.770
what role your journalism past played

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.650
in your entrepreneurship.

00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:56.051
Interested?

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:00.931
Let's walk and talk.

00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:01.850
Let's go.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.211
Wipe your mouth.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.051
My deal with Yuanhang Fund is settled.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.130
You don't need
to flatter Jiang Liang anymore.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.890
The collaboration has just begun.

00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:54.051
There's a long journey ahead.

00:16:56.051 --> 00:16:57.650
Any connection that's beneficial to you,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.730
I'll spare no effort

00:17:00.451 --> 00:17:01.650
to maintain it well for you.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.770
I think I'm really useless.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.050
Xu Yan is truly impressive.

00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:21.891
She's beautiful,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:23.691
smart,

00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:26.090
and capable.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.371
Jiang Yun is such an aloof person.

00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:34.211
I don't even dare to approach her.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.770
Yet Xu Yan convinced her

00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:39.010
with just a few words.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.290
I truly am becoming more aware

00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:45.891
of why she's so captivating to you.

00:17:50.691 --> 00:17:52.131
I really can't compare to her.

00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:25.010
Drink some warm milk
to soothe your stomach.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.010
Thanks, Haoming.

00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:48.691
Mr. Shen, I'll take her home first.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.691
I just wanted to check
if you have a fever.

00:19:26.651 --> 00:19:27.851
There's nothing between us.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.050
Don't think being nice

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.072
will make me fall for you.

00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:36.851
My heart

00:19:37.851 --> 00:19:39.451
belongs solely to Shen Haoming.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.131
It was true before,

00:19:43.211 --> 00:19:44.851
and will remain so.

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.864
Why put yourself through this?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.451
He has a wife and family.

00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:51.891
They have a loving marriage.

00:19:52.611 --> 00:19:54.411
There's no possibility between you two.

00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:58.050
You don't need to worry about that.

00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:01.050
Between him and me,

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.770
there's an unbreakable bond.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.248
Outsiders wouldn't understand.

00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:17.411
Let's go.

00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:20.171
- Where to?
- Wait.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.770
You feel something's missing too.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.530
Haoming, come on.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.290
Haoming.

00:21:19.824 --> 00:21:20.912
What are you doing here?

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.611
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:27.451
I thought about it a lot,

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.570
and still want to ask you.

00:21:31.611 --> 00:21:33.451
About you making me interview Ms. Jiang,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.490
why didn't you ask me first?

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.131
I just became a host recently.

00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.971
I'm still inexperienced.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.411
If I ended up ruining

00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:48.050
your collaboration, what then?

00:21:48.651 --> 00:21:49.851
You're my wife.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.810
You have what it takes.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.770
Didn't you perform well today?

00:21:57.171 --> 00:21:58.131
I'm very satisfied.

00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:00.730
Stop overthinking.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.371
Go to sleep now.

00:22:07.131 --> 00:22:07.891
Mr. Shen,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.411
I'll be straight.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.976
I asked to meet today to discuss

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.810
your proposed strategic partnership
for the New District project.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.280
I'm looking forward to it.
Please go ahead.

00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:23.131
I had a wonderful conversation
with your wife yesterday.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.570
However, many companies

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:27.131
are currently seeking our investment.

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:29.360
Four have made the preliminary list.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.411
Although you're among them,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.931
I won't choose you

00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:34.851
simply because your wife

00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:37.490
shares my profession or interests.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:38.810
Understood.

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:40.371
Mr. Shen,

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.570
my sister speaks diplomatically,

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.171
but I'll be blunt.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.250
Frankly speaking,

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.090
you're not the best candidate.

00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:51.971
Without backing from the parent company,

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.770
going solo is too risky
without safety nets.

00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:57.490
So why should we choose you?

00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:03.090
Regarding your mention
of my wife earlier,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.090
she's a public figure

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.651
whose reputation is built
on authenticity

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.090
and credibility.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.851
Any dishonesty

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.971
would be devastating

00:23:15.651 --> 00:23:17.490
for both our careers.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.131
That's why

00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:22.851
we must be more authentic,

00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:24.050
more responsible,

00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.211
and more meticulous.

00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:28.250
You're quite articulate.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.451
In just a few sentences,

00:23:31.131 --> 00:23:32.411
it's all to your advantage.

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.530
Last night,

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.730
we were photographed together

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.810
(Shining Business, Dazzling Banquet)
at the banquet.

00:23:48.211 --> 00:23:49.090
This morning,

00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.570
(Xunchao Hot Search)
it's already trending.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.730
But most importantly...

00:23:57.091 --> 00:23:58.971
(Jinda Group, Yuanhang Fund, Stocks)

00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.770
Both Jinda and Yuanhang's stocks
are rising.

00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:06.611
To be honest,

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.131
the current investment for me

00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:11.490
happens to also involve four companies.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.931
So why should I choose Yuanhang?

00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:18.250
I'll wait for your call.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.530
Interesting.

00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:43.411
Weren't you supposed
to meet clients today?

00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:46.490
I finished early and wanted
to have lunch with you.

00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:55.891
This is for you.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.530
Why are you giving me a gift?

00:25:05.851 --> 00:25:07.330
Isn't this too expensive?

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.451
I have good news.

00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:13.290
Yuanhang and I
have reached a cooperation.

00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:15.851
So that means

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.651
the New District project
can move forward.

00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:21.691
Convincing them wasn't easy.

00:25:22.451 --> 00:25:24.530
Luckily, I have a capable wife.

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.330
This deal couldn't have been done

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.770
without you.

00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.131
Do you think I don't realize that?

00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:34.131
It's not because I got along
with Ms. Jiang

00:25:34.171 --> 00:25:35.611
that she chose to work with you.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.651
My role was just to create

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.050
a harmonious communication space.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.171
The real motivator was mutual benefits.

00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:45.691
So the one who made this happen

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.931
is you, not me.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.570
Such an expensive gift

00:25:51.691 --> 00:25:52.691
makes me feel unworthy.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.131
As my wife,
you should get used to gifts.

00:26:02.371 --> 00:26:03.891
Get in the car. Let's go.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.290
It suits you well.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:44.816
(The more valuable Haoming's gifts are,)

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.171
(the deeper my guilt grows.)

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.211
(They keep reminding me)

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.250
(that can these lies)

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.611
(truly withstand sunlight?)

00:26:56.899 --> 00:27:00.816
(Shanxi Jinxing Bank)

00:27:01.971 --> 00:27:02.931
What's for dinner?

00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:04.570
My mom went to Jingzhou for orthopedics.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:05.490
Guess who we saw there?

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.891
- Who?
- Mr. Lin's fiancée, Qiao Lin.

00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:09.250
They just broke up,

00:27:09.411 --> 00:27:10.611
and she's already upgraded.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.211
The chief orthopedic doctor

00:27:12.411 --> 00:27:13.451
is talented and handsome.

00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:14.211
You're right.

00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:16.651
Maybe she was already seeing him

00:27:16.691 --> 00:27:18.010
- before breaking up with Mr. Lin.
- Exactly!

00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:24.651
What's wrong?

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.611
My heart hurts.

00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:37.090
This is orthopedics.

00:27:37.931 --> 00:27:38.931
If it's heart issues,

00:27:38.931 --> 00:27:39.891
we can't help here.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.611
Cancel your registration
and visit cardiology instead.

00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:44.451
Stop pretending.

00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:46.611
You must tell me today

00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:48.570
where you're hiding Qiao Lin.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:50.971
Let me make this clear.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.851
Hiding won't work.

00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:54.851
I'm persistent.

00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:57.691
I'm using my remaining sanity

00:27:57.851 --> 00:27:59.090
to be civil with you.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.611
Don't make me expose

00:28:01.691 --> 00:28:03.131
all your dirty secrets.

00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:06.090
First, I have no secrets.

00:28:06.411 --> 00:28:08.371
Second, leave if you're not here
for treatment.

00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:10.411
Stop wasting medical resources.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.451
I've noticed you're thick-skinned.

00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:17.651
You seduce someone's fiancée.

00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:20.171
When the groom came looking for you,

00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:21.770
you still act innocent.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.050
You've kept me awake at night.

00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:27.010
Don't think you can brush this off

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.451
with a few words. No way!

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.770
Are you here for treatment or not?
If not, just leave.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.971
You're enabling evil, you know?

00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:35.770
He's a homewrecker!

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:38.010
Liu, call security.

00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:39.851
Go ahead.

00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:41.010
Get your dean here.

00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.931
Let your leaders and colleagues see

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.050
what a morally corrupt

00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:45.530
- homewrecking man...
- Lin Tao!

00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:00.651
- What do you want?
- What now?

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.250
I finally catch you red-handed.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.611
What did I say?

00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:06.891
Right after leaving me,
you've found someone new.

00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:07.810
Lin,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.931
just be blunt to me today.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.691
Were you together
behind my back long ago?

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:13.490
Are you done yet?

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:14.770
This is a hospital.

00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:17.090
Didn't you always claim

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.451
you're educated high-class person?

00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:20.611
You're making a scene here,
disturbing other patients.

00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:22.171
Is this what you call high-class?

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.891
Since when did you learn
to twist the truth?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.570
You want to lecture me about manners?

00:29:28.211 --> 00:29:30.371
Yu Yiming destroyed families.

00:29:30.411 --> 00:29:31.411
That makes him classy?

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.330
A morally corrupt person like him
can't possibly be a good doctor.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.691
Now you're just spouting nonsense.

00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:38.290
How did he destroy families?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.770
Whose family did he destroy?

00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:41.411
Did we ever make a family?

00:29:42.211 --> 00:29:43.730
We broke up ages ago, okay?

00:29:43.971 --> 00:29:46.090
We have zero connection now.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.371
If you keep harassing me like this,
it counts as harassment, you know?

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.211
Wait.

00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:51.851
I'm begging you.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.211
Just come back with me.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.411
I came specifically to get you.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.211
Hopeless.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.250
I don't want to speak to you at all now.

00:29:59.371 --> 00:29:59.931
Get out.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.651
Then tell me where you live now.
Is he treating you well?

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.371
No. I'm sorry.

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.184
(Advanced Mathematics)

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.651
You're attending adult college?

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.050
- What's it to you?
- Just to be worthy of Yu Yiming?

00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:16.250
Are you insane?

00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:17.770
What twisted logic is this?

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.131
My studies have nothing to do with him.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.131
Your mental gymnastics amaze me.

00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:25.010
Still lying to me, huh?

00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:26.611
Lin.

00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:29.851
You used to complain
that I shouldn't despise you.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.290
But now?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.530
Yu Yiming is the one who actually

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.691
despise you.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.250
He knows you hate studying,

00:30:38.611 --> 00:30:40.090
and you're not cut out for it.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.611
Yet for his own pride,
he forces you to study.

00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:44.171
This is emotional manipulation.

00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:46.171
I might have said things,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.171
but in my heart,

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.330
I've always accepted your lack
of education and common sense.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.490
Well, thank you.

00:30:55.411 --> 00:30:56.931
Thanks for accepting me

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.931
as some uneducated, brainless woman.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.131
I'm so grateful.

00:31:00.211 --> 00:31:01.611
- How can I ever thank you enough?
- Qiao Lin! Qiao Lin!

00:31:02.931 --> 00:31:04.090
No fighting in the hospital.

00:31:04.131 --> 00:31:05.010
Talk it out properly.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.290
Yu Yiming, this doesn't concern you.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.171
Even if she kills me today,

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.851
you have no right to interfere.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.050
Because you'll never measure up to me.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.330
Let me be blunt.

00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:22.290
Qiao Lin was my first love.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.651
No one's relationship can compare

00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:26.770
to what we had.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.931
- He's crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.730
These were all selected
by Mr. Shen for you.

00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:43.730
Happy birthday.

00:31:45.891 --> 00:31:46.651
Thank you.

00:31:46.931 --> 00:31:47.611
We'll leave now.

00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:48.171
Thank you.

00:31:52.483 --> 00:31:54.544
(To Yan: Happy Birthday, 6 PM, Haoming)

00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:04.770
(Meet at Agave at 6 PM)

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:11.691
Okay.

00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:19.728
(Fang Lei Calling)

00:32:20.211 --> 00:32:20.651
Hello?

00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:24.770
Time flies. He's grown so tall.

00:32:27.536 --> 00:32:28.688
Who allowed you to meet him?

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.931
I miss him terribly.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.090
Where are you now?

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.290
- You're here?
- Who allowed you to meet him?

00:32:45.851 --> 00:32:47.810
I couldn't help myself today.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.691
So I went to see him.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.530
He looks just like me.

00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:58.971
This is your final warning.
Don't cross the line again.

00:33:02.611 --> 00:33:03.691
Just kidding.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.411
It's Yan's birthday today, right?

00:33:23.152 --> 00:33:25.451
Mr. Shen's not here.
He asked you to wait in the backyard.

00:33:25.451 --> 00:33:26.290
He'll be back soon.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.171
Okay. Thank you.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.010
I'll head off work.

00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:44.331
Did I interrupt
your little romantic time?

00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:46.331
I'm sorry.

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:50.371
It seems

00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:53.291
you still care about us deep down.

00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:59.811
- If you leave, I'll really go meet him.
- Don't you dare!

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.371
I don't need anyone's permission

00:35:07.411 --> 00:35:08.731
before meeting him.

00:35:14.771 --> 00:35:16.451
We're related by blood.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.251
You and I are family bound by ties

00:35:21.331 --> 00:35:22.690
that can never be severed.

00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:26.731
But I don't understand
why you had to marry someone

00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:28.010
completely unrelated to us.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.170
Why couldn't you wait for me?

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.050
Fang Lei.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.610
For your sister's sake,

00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:48.570
please let me go.

00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.291
Then I'll go find my sister.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.490
What's that?

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:04.090
Put it down!

00:36:07.523 --> 00:36:08.368
(Acetagastrodin Tablets)

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:49.811
Yan.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.210
Chen Lin,

00:36:51.971 --> 00:36:53.490
do you know where Shen Haoming is?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.811
Mr. Shen said
he has an appointment with you.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.731
He left work early for his studio.

00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:02.851
Never mind. Thanks.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.010
You're back.

00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:29.936
You didn't answer the phone.
I thought something happened to you.

00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:30.891
I'm fine.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.291
Shifeng and Jinda
are signing a contract.

00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:36.050
There was an urgent meeting,
so I put my phone on silent.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.971
Have you eaten? Are you hungry?
I make you a midnight snack, okay?

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.371
I'm not hungry. I had a snack earlier.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.971
You must've been waiting long.

00:37:52.851 --> 00:37:54.851
It's okay. I know
you had urgent matters.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.210
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.490
Happy birthday.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.451
I'll take a shower first.
Then we'll have cake together.

00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:04.371
Okay.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.010
What happened to her?

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.771
I don't know, either.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.811
She had an accident while diving.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.650
Does Mr. Fang know yet?

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.650
My father's almost here.
