[Episode 11]

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.450
Liu Bingqiang,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.650
where were you last Wednesday night?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.500
I don't recall.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.650
Here's a little reminder for you.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.229
The wild beach in Zhangjiang.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.070
Officer, what are you talking about?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.479
That beach thing
doesn't ring a bell with me.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.039
Fine.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.450
Then take a look at this.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.400
Has it jogged your memory?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.070
Officer,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.090
is it illegal to stroll by the sea?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.490
No, that's not illegal.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.630
But the refrigerated truck drivers

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.360
and the porters all confessed

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.140
that it was you who hired them that day

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.079
to transport goods to the beach.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.380
I'm giving you a chance now.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360
I can't control what they say, can I?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm telling you,
I'm feeling terrible right now

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.740
in this condition.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.400
Tell me

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.150
who exactly texted you and told you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.090
to withdraw.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.090
I'm in pain.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.310
Liu Bingqiang,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.590
stop pretending, will you?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.000
Listen,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400
you'd better come clean.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.430
Why the yelling?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.290
What kind of attitude is this?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.750
Criminal suspects are humans too.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.880
What has he done now?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.870
He is being all slippery and evasive.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.329
He just wouldn't confess.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.280
Alright. Apologize.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
I'm sorry for his rudeness.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.940
Apologize.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.590
Apologize!

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.080
I'm sorry.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.280
Get out.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.420
You're recovering well.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.710
Knowing you had woken up,
I thought you'd be hungry,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.570
so I brought you
noodles cooked with pork trotters.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.360
I forgot you couldn't eat this
in such a condition.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.220
This might be bad for your health.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.020
I know

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.040
you definitely won't disclose anything.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.060
Even Yang Min has confessed.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.680
This is a very serious case.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.079
You can't take the heat.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280
To be honest,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.210
I find your behavior quite baffling.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.710
You finally turned a new leaf
after spending many years in prison.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.040
Don't you think you're being foolish now?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.030
Of course,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.089
I know someone must have forced you.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.870
But can you honestly say
you never thought about

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.160
committing crimes one last time

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.290
to make a big fortune

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.960
that you could leave to Wen?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.350
Well, you meant to do
what's best for your son.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.100
But why did you drag him into this mess?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.690
Officer Luo,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.670
threatening me with my son, aren't you?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.430
Nonsense.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.180
I'm a police officer.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.830
How could I threaten you?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.220
I'm simply sticking to the facts.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.970
Our acts are based on evidence.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.380
Alright.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.110
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.440
Have a good rest.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.300
I'm leaving now.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.780
Oh, right.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.480
If you're dissatisfied

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.780
with that young officer from earlier,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.830
just file a complaint.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.360
Okay?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.570
Are you really not going to say anything?

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.560
Fine.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.330
I'll keep Wen safe.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.740
Officer Luo.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.050
My son doesn't know anything.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.950
I lied to him.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.500
He doesn't know anything?

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.870
Then you must know everything.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.130
He really has nothing to do with this.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.830
What do you want?

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.350
I think you're well aware

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.060
that claiming he's innocent won't help.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.090
This is drug trafficking.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.280
Offenders can be executed for trafficking
a certain amount. Do you know that number?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.410
You can keep silent.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.120
We've figured out everything,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.190
with a complete chain of evidence.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.790
I only have one question now.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.510
Did you guys plant a spy in our squad?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.740
Give me a name.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.380

The person who let him go

how is Duozai doing?

He's safe now.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.730
I know what you're worried about.

Actually, just like you,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.050
I'd hate to see anything happen to Duozai.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.040
That's because Duozai is top talent

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.140

in the future.

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.020

to make to Chief Cheng?

I'll take the floor then, Chief Cheng.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.160
On the night in question,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.120
due to our operation,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.380
those drug dealers failed to make drugs.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.440
But the drug cook

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.110

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.240
managed to escape.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.120
Now, we suspect

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.700
Gu Zhifeng was the one
who tipped them off.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.120
I believe they'll get in contact again.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.510
Based on
Captain Luo's investigation results,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.410
it was indeed Gu Zhifeng

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.960
who gave the drug dealers

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.090
a heads up on the night in question.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.549
Since Gu was transferred here
from the Narcotics Control Brigade

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.590
years ago,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.000
he's been hard-working and dedicated.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.659
An adequate officer, I'd say.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.270
It won't be long before he retires.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.630
But who would've thought?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.030
I assure you, Chief Fang,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.600

in my bureau is crooked,

You go get the goods,

I've never transported goods.

Most of the goods in the SUV were burned,

and the drug production
at the beach failed.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.550
Could it be
that Mou Haidong still has goods in stock?

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.480
Or maybe the drug cook can offer more?

that given the unhealthy environment

it can't happen
without approved applications.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.550
These application materials
brought by the lawyer, Mr. Huang,

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.800
should be Mou Lang's.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.800
Yes.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.720
But hasn't Mou Lang

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.400
been taken

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.520
by Liu Libo to Xinji as a hostage?

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.240
There's no way they'd set him free.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.270
Judging by the documents,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.110
the applicant should be Mou Lang.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.400
And I'm telling you,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.720
this visitation application

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.780
has been approved.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.350
Before Mou Haidong is executed,

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.350
the lawyer will bring Mou Lang over.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.890
Now I understand.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.160
I get it now.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.490
Well,

Mou Haidong has more than one son.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920
The person coming to see him

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.030
is very likely to be the drug cook,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.720
right?

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.750
Okay.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.710

The Mou family has never treated you well.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.170
Does it even matter whether to be admitted

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.900
into the ancestral hall or not?

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.230
It's not worth what you've put in.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.800
Neither do I think it's worth it.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.630
But being accepted by the ancestral hall
was my mother's dying wish.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.360

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.600
But what are we attending
the temple fair for?

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.130
This is Luo Yuansu,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.030
the drug cook we're looking for.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.030
[Wanted Notice]

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.610
He might show up that day.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.560
But...

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.630
there are no signs of Tang Du

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.830
and Liu Libo attending the temple fair.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.200
Here's what I think.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.510
Tang Du and Liu Libo might both be decoys.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.260
That can be a possibility.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.320
Maybe they're going for
a diversion tactic this time.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.250
Even if the chance of success is 1%,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.570
we must put 100% of hard work in it.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.250
I'm on your side.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.160
Did you hear me?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.960
Let's go.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:19.760
Time to eat!

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.440
Now, the problem is,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.970
we need to deliver the remaining goods

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.850
in exchange for the hostages.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.830
But you don't have enough goods.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:33.960
I've made some more.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.090
Now, I need someone

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.520
to transport the goods.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.440
Which of you would like to do it?

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.210
Why are you looking at the two of us?

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.640
Don't you know why?

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.360
We're talking about rescuing Duozai.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.180
He's your son.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.760
Don't you know how serious this is?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.150
Plus, when the work is done,

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.410
you'll make a fortune.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:09.830
Think it over.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:11.450
Let me do it.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.110
I feel like
I've got Duozai into hot water.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.510
I had trouble sleeping
in the past two days.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.710
Who are you to take on this task,

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.360
huh?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.510
Why can't I do it?

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.640
I'm his best friend.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.020
And I'm his father!

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.230
Let you do it?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.260
Stay out of this!

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.800
You're so weak

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.930
and inexperienced.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.150
It's okay.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.960
As long as we deliver the goods,

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.530
Duozai and my brother
will both come back safely.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.670
Which route to take?

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.200
How to transport the goods?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.530
[Build a beautiful home
and a model civilized city]

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.840
It's all set.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.850
I've designed a route.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.230
Drive the truck to the designated spot,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.010
and someone will guide you out.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.150
Level with me.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.350
How good are the odds?

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.000
Eighty percent.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.670
The rest depends on your ability
to cope with emergencies.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.550
What a high chance of winning!

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.030
It's worth a gamble.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.630
[Build a beautiful home
and a model civilized city]

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.070
Good.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.440
Uncle Ma,

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.250
Uncle Ma!

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.570
Wish you good luck.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.760
Thank you.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.090
May good luck be with me.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.110
Uncle, watch out for danger.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.360
Give this to Duozai.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.510
Why are you doing this?

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.320
Do you even need to ask?

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.890
It's just in case.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.550
If something happens to me,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.880
at least Duozai will have a sum of money

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.400
and not too much hatred for me.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.320
Why do you have to say such a scary thing?

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.670
What's so scary about it?

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.480
It's not like I'm giving it to you.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.410
It's for Duozai.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.530
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.810
Wish me wealth and luck!

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.890
Come back soon, Uncle.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:35.960
Master Du,

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.240
I've arrived.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.880
Get in a black Honda
whose license plate is 95952.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.450
Liu Libo has set out.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.740
Okay. Keep a close watch.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.910
[To the hotel lobby]

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.280
Luo,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.660
we're following them.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.760
Okay. Keep a close watch.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.090
Don't let them spot you.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.830
Master Du,

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.220
we're being followed.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.510
Get rid of them.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.720
The target took the exit
to the No. 1 East Road.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:52.880
Team One is down.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.010
Team Two, take over.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.480
Team Two is on it.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.620
We're being followed.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.550
They found me out.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.010
Let Team Two fill in.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.870
Team Two is on it.
