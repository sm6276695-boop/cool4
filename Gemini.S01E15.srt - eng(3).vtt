(Gemini)

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.520
(Episode 15)

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.960
Do not come closer!

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
I will not...

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.760
I will not let you touch my savior!

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
Savior?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560
I am going to kill you!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You wench!

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.880
How dare you kill your husband?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.600
Xue Lian, fear not.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.040
If the good do not contend,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.080
they will only yield
the way to the wicked.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If you fear him,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.720
you will be forced to kill yourself.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120
If you are not afraid,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.240
then he is nothing.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
Look.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040
Fighting back...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360
is not that hard.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320
You wench!

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.480
What do you want?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600
Are you really going to kill me?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.320
I will gut you!

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.800
You are right.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.760
I want to kill you!

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400
For the past seven years,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
you forced me to go out every day
to earn money for you.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.760
When things did not go well,
you hit me and scolded me.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.320
And you even sold me off
to be humiliated.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.440
An animal like you...

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.520
deserves to die!

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120
He is dead.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.800
I killed him myself.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
My savior.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.200
Thank you for bringing me back
and freeing me.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.600
I was able to get my revenge.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600
That wench must have escaped home.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.960
- Come on, search the place!
- Search the place!

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880
They are here to silence me.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.879
You should go.
I do not want to drag you down.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.360
Stay here. I will deal with them.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
- My savior...
- Stay put.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
Come out!

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.720
Where is she? Speak!

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.360
I do not know. Please spare me.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240
How dare you?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Who gave you the guts...

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
to set up a private brothel...

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
and disregard human lives?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Do you have a death wish?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280
Tell me.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600
Who is your master?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.960
He is no ordinary fighter.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680
He hid poison in his teeth.
He is a suicide warrior.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.720
How did you end up provoking him?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.040
When I was buying hairpins,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.280
I noticed that my seeds of longing
had fallen off.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.080
Since you were buying
sweet glutinous rice balls,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
I went to look for it.

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.999
In the end, I bumped into a girl...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.080
who escaped from a secret brothel.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480
And at the very end,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.840
it is as you see.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.520
You are not mad, are you?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.079
Next time you encounter
something like this,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
just tell me.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Eat it while it is hot.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400
It will get cold soon.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.320
I will clear up these bodies.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720
All right.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.760
After I was sold off,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.040
I was blindfolded
by the human broker.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.320
They took me
on a long carriage ride.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.560
I even walked a long way
through a secret passage.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880
When I got out
of the secret passage,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.520
I found myself
in an underground secret brothel.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.160
I could not bear such humiliation.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.280
When the guards were not looking,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.960
I hid beneath the carriage
where the bodies were hidden.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680
That is how I escaped.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280
Do you remember...

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.120
what was above the secret brothel?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200
I do not remember.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.080
I hid beneath the carriage.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
I did not dare to speak,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.320
much less look around.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320
However,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.440
I vaguely glimpsed
through the cracks...

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.000
and saw a few rows
of big red lanterns.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.000
Big red lanterns?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Jifang House.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.480
That is the Qiang people's
favorite teahouse.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920
There is something off...

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
about these Qiang people.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.720
I will send my men there now.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080
We will surround and wipe them out.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080
No.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.560
I heard from those inside...

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.120
that the secret brothel
was filled with explosives...

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800
and full of traps.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240
If you force your way in,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.359
the mechanisms
will trigger automatically,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720
and it will be blown
to pieces at once.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.479
You are not thinking
of sneaking in there...

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.800
and rescuing them yourself, are you?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
My savior.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.800
It is very dangerous in there.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960
I am familiar with the brothel.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240
If anyone has to go,
it should be me.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.280
Master Xiao.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600
What should we do then?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440
I will go with you.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.400
Master, a girl escaped
from the pavilion today.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680
I have sent men
to pursue and kill her.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720
So useless!

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.400
If this happens again,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.400
you will have to pay
for it with your life.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080
Yes.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000
Arrange for a new batch of girls.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.160
Make sure our guests
have a good time.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760
Yes.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120
Chief.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280
We found the human broker.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640
The black market sent word...

00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:31.480
that they are sending in
new girls tonight.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360
Prepare some rouge
and embroidery work.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560
Move!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Hurry up!

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
Get moving!

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440
Faster!

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600
Move!

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.840
Faster!

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.120
There are beauties.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.280
I have a lot of money.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.880
I want to buy all of them.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760
Get lost!

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240
Do not get yourself killed.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.000
If you know what is good for you,
scram!

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.760
Sir, I failed to recognize
your standing.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.760
I will leave now. At once.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.880
The carriage is coming.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960
Check their blindfolds again.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.919
One, two, three, four, five,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.080
- Wear your blindfolds properly!
- six, seven,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
- Behave!
- eight, nine, ten, eleven,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
twelve.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.920
I remember I caught 10 girls.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.600
Why is it 12 now?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.480
Two more people
mean two more payments.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440
Move out!

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560
Keep up and move faster!

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.680
Go.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.960
Move, hurry up.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.760
Hurry up. I'm talking to you.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.440
- Behave!
- Move your feet.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720
Get moving!

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.440
Why is this path so familiar?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600
- Go!
- Come on.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040
Hurry up!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200
And this smell...

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.520
Could this place be...

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480
Zhaoyue Pavilion?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640
- Stay close!
- Faster.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.320
Later,
when our honored guest comes,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.080
you must treat him well.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.560
If our honored guest
is even the slightest dissatisfied,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.040
I will tear your face off.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560
Do you understand?

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.800
My little beauty.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.640
My little beauty.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.080
Stop hiding.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.080
Come out and play with me.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080
Come on out,

00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:07.160
little beauty.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.560
Where are you?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.960
If I catch you,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.280
I will punish you, yes?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960
- This way.
- My little beauty.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.040
My little beauty, where are you?

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.880
Are you playing
hide-and-seek with me?

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.400
Do not let me catch you later.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Hush.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600
Hush.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.880
Do not laugh.
If you do, I will kiss you.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.440
So this is the Qiang leader
hiding in Ying.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.560
He must be today's honored guest.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.800
You cannot kill him here.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.239
- My little beauty.
- Otherwise,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.600
we cannot interrogate him.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
- You are still laughing?
- Where are you?

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.840
I will stall him here.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.160
You go find the gunpowder.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880
You?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.240
- What? Can't I?
- My little beauty.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.320
- Okay.
- If I find you,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.119
there will be a punishment.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120
I am going.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.240
Come out, my little beauty.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.320
Honored guest.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
Are you looking for me?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.880
So tasty!

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.280
They really picked
a tasty one for me this time.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.959
- Beauty.
- Hush.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.760
Do not be nice to me.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320
Honored guest,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320
slow down.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800
All right.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.640
Come here, my little beauty.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.080
- Very well.
- Good wine goes well with beauties.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880
Do not run!

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440
Hey, pretty lady.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.880
We all call the madam
of the secret brothel...

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520
"Mother."

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.440
If any of the new girls
refused to take clients,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.040
she would hand them over
to her men...

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360
to be abused and killed.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.640
She likes to drink
when she checks the books.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.960
She also has
a special enamel wine set.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.480
There are guards
stationed on her floor.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240
Why are you so slow?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.800
- Mother is getting impatient.
- Forgive me, I am useless.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.360
Mother asked me
to bring her a jar of wine.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.280
- Go upstairs.
- Yes.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200
Mother.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.960
I have brought you some wine.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480
Come in.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
Mother.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.240
Where did you hide the gunpowder?

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280
Who sent you?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.240
You do not deserve to know.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.760
Then no one will be there
to bury you!

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.040
If you dare make a sound,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.840
I will pierce your throat.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.760
Can you tell me now...

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.360
where the gunpowder is hidden?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.400
I will tell you.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.640
The gunpowder
is hidden behind this wall.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.200
That candlestick is the trigger.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.840
The gunpowder is hidden in the room.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.759
Are you not afraid of blowing
yourself up if it goes off?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.159
My master hired a specialist
to design the secret room.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.720
As long as it is not forced,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.080
it will not go off accidentally.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.600
How do we destroy the mechanism
controlling the gunpowder?

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.000
The candlestick's wick is
the fuse for the explosives.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360
All you have to do...

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.480
is pull it out.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
Who is your master?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.160
I... I really do not know.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.760
He always wears a mask
when he comes.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.600
I have never seen his real face.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160
You do not know?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280
Then you are useless.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.560
I was right.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.520
My goodness.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.240
No way.
