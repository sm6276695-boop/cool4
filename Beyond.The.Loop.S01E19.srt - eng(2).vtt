Wan.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.360
Are you okay?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.840
I'll do it myself.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.920
I'm glad then.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.800
Why didn't you follow the plan?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.480
That's my line.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.720
You sent assassins to kill us?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.000
Luo Shishi.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.800
You never intended
to cooperate properly.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.400
Moreover,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840
you didn't bring your master today.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.680
I won't obey your orders.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.280
It's our first collaboration.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.760
Naturally, I had to test you.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.680
If you show obedient,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.560
you'll get to meet him.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360
I hope you to keep your word.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.240
I'm not a patient person.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.408
(City Lord's Mansion)

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360
Everyone, pause your tasks.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.160
I have something to announce.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.840
Wei Feng, bring him in.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.400
Mu Yunqing, what's wrong?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.520
Recently,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.480
the mansion hasn't been peaceful.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
I'm sure you've all noticed.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.520
Therefore, I set a trap

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.840
to lure out the traitor.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.160
I never expected

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.240
the traitor would be Liu Bingmo.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.560
Yunqing, is there any misunderstanding?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.160
Liu Bingmo works for me.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.920
Wei Feng.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.160
We found this on him.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.440
We wouldn't have caught him

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.279
without drugging him.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.440
How is this possible?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.800
You didn't take this, right?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
Tell me the truth.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.080
Have you been framed?

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440
I'm here.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.320
Just tell the truth.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.200
Say it!

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.000
Liu Bingmo!

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.040
He won't even deny it!

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.920
If not him, then who?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.280
Given these facts,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.320
do as you want.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.320
Liu Bingmo.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.440
I'll ask you one last time.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280
Did you take the City Lord Token?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.040
If not, just say no!

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.160
Did you?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.880
Did you?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.440
My lady, do you believe me?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.480
I do.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.160
Liu Bingmo, let her go!

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.240
Don't move!

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.520
- Liu Bingmo. Are you insane?
- Stay back.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.360
I'm not, but you are.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.840
Liu Bingmo.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.880
Let her go and I'll spare you!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.800
Drop that hypocritical act!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.360
How did you treat her

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.680
before the wedding ceremony?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.120
Now that she's useful to you,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.720
then you treat her well now?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.280
You're just serving
your own selfish desires!

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.360
You disgust me!

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.760
Liu Bingmo, let me go!

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.280
And you might still escape!

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.480
My lady, back at the cabin,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.520
if he truly wanted to protect you,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.360
why would he repeatedly endanger you?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.840
It's no use saying all this now.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.280
It's still not too late.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.280
My lady, it's already too late.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.840
Go!

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.480
Why are you here?

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.080
Here to help you.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.760
Help me?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.040
Look at these injuries you have.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960
I thought you were after wealth,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.120
never expected you love Yu Yingwan.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.520
You did all this for her,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.400
yet she only loves Mu Yunqing.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.520
Worth it?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.320
What's your point?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.600
How about killing Mu Yunqing?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.080
I take the City Lord Token,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160
and you'd get Yu Yingwan.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.240
Perfect, right?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.280
Want me to betray my lady?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.800
You already did!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.120
You!

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.800
You don't have a way back.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.080
Only I can offer a new way.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.040
Think it over.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.240
I'll come to you tomorrow same time.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.632
(The next day)

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.080
Quite impressive.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.360
You brought Mu Yunqing here?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.400
Time to fulfill

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.440
what you promised me.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.760
I need to know
who I'm risking my life for.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.360
The City Lord Token?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.000
They hid it.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.800
But I think it's in the mansion.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.920
In that case,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.040
there's no need
to keep Mu Yunqing alive.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.640
Open it.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.760
Mu Yunqing, why aren't you dead yet?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.240
You've tried every trick
to obtain the City Lord Token.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.360
Why?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.480
What's the point?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.800
You've captured me.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.800
Do as you please.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.640
You have committed so many evil deeds.
And you deserve death.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.480
But we won't let you die easily.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.200
Unless you tell me

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.760
the person behind you.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.040
Yu Yingwan, you are clever, right?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.720
Figure it out yourself.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.920
This place is dark and damp.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.120
Let's go back.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.800
You deceived me?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.840
Quite bold, aren't you?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.680
My lady, it hurts!

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.480
You deceived me

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480
and took me hostage.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.440
You!

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.280
It hurts, my lady.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.920
This was all for the City Lord's safety.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.200
He asked me to do so,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.000
and I had to obey.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.640
Wan, about this...

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600
You!

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.440
Tell me

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.920
every single detail now!

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400
Madam...

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.200
Stay out of this.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.960
Don't look at him. Look at me.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.080
My lady, actually all of this

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.480
traces back to the moonlight that night.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.680
Right, right.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.880
Moonlight?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.600
City Lord, you summoned me?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.520
I heard Luo Shishi
requested to meet you.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.680
Yes. I planned to arrest her.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.880
Liu Bingmo, let me show you something.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.480
What is it?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.200
What are you doing?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.320
It won't kill you.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.280
No, I have matters to attend to.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.720
I need to go now.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.560
You are so scared.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.360
How can I entrust tasks
to you like this?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.480
City Lord, thank you.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.080
But I don't want
to take on tasks right now.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.280
I just want to protect my lady.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.360
What I'm asking you to do now

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.880
is to protect Wan.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.720
If you don't cooperate,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.080
I won't let you be Wan's guard.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.800
City Lord, what do you want me to do?

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.440
I want you to help Luo Shishi

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.480
use the City Lord Token
to lure out the person behind her.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.600
That's easy.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.720
That's easy.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.640
Well, find someone else for this.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.880
Find someone else to do this.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.800
I can't handle it.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.480
If you don't,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.320
Wan will be hurt.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.040
What do you mean?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.200
We have a traitor.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.800
The assassins we captured earlier

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.400
died mysteriously in prison.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.120
We have

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.280
to catch a fake traitor,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.480
so they'll lower their guard

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.640
and reveal themselves.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.920
Then we can eliminate them all.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.640
A traitor?

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.200
City Lord,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.960
your plan sounds brilliant.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.160
But I'm afraid I can't handle it.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.240
Only you can handle it.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.240
They'll only believe it if you do it.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.480
Does my lady know?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.680
She mustn't know.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.720
You'll need to take Wan hostage

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.360
to make everyone think
you've betrayed her.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.280
Keep this a secret.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.040
But I must warn you.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.600
If things go wrong,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.480
you might get injured

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.200
or even get killed.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.840
Think it over.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.080
City Lord, I'll do it.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.560
This is it.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.600
I dare not hide anything from you.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.800
You took such dangerous actions.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.080
Even if you didn't inform me,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.960
should at least have told Wei Feng.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.680
Right, Wei Feng?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.400
If anything dangerous
had happened to you,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.600
Wei Feng should've

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.120
blamed them severely.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.600
Right, Wei Feng?

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.840
Well...

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.520
What's going on?

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.560
You brat!

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.600
How dare you steal buns!

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720
I'll beat you to death!

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.600
In broad daylight,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.640
how can you hit her?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.080
Come, stand up.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280
Since you protect her,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.040
why not pay for the buns?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.440
Pay it.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.480
Here, take it.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.240
Get lost!

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.320
Are you okay?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.440
I'm okay.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.520
Girl, tell me,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.120
where are you from?

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.200
Sir, I came from outside the city.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.000
There are many others like me out there

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.520
who can't get enough food

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.840
and have nowhere to live.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.320
Don't be afraid, girl.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.960
In Jin City, no one goes hungry.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.720
It seems that the situation
is really complicated.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.840
What should we do?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.200
We can't just ignore this.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.600
Wei Feng, open the gates

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.040
and provide relief.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.320
City Lord, please think it over.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.400
Our grain reserves

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.680
can't feed so many people.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.680
Just open the gates.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.800
I'll handle the rest.
