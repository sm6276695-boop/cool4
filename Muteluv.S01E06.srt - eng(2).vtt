WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
I’ll expose the Chantharisatu’s scam.

00:00:05.064 --> 00:00:06.408
Chantharusati.

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:07.504
Along with Ploy.

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:11.488
You are so busted.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.144
Got you.

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:14.904
What are you doing?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.472
Comrade Phupar.

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.312
Now, you have been reborn.

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:23.080
You did well.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.176
Why is my heart suddenly beating fast?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.872
when I am near you.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:45.768
This always seems to happen to me.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.272
I never thought

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.560
when we went undercover
in the Chatharusati cult,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.816
Phu would turn into one of their followers.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.000
Meanwhile,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.952
Meanwhile,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.688
I was caught.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.528
What happened after that?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.888
After that…

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.856
Heart racing, your ass!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.824
You!

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.024
Who are you?

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.120
Why are you so beautiful?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.848
So glowing.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.808
Like the moonlight.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.352
The prophecy is coming true.

00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:47.260
Mother of Chatharusati has descended.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.680
Mother.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.648
- Mother.
- Let me go.

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:06.790
- Mother.
- Let me go.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.080
Let me go.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.808
Help me.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:24.912
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.136
Here is your dress.

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:34.208
Let me go.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.856
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.256
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:50.072
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.360
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.888
Wishing you a joyous marriage,
blessed with children.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.320
I’m sorry.

00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:41.060
I’m too nervous.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.496
(I never expected this.)

00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:52.936
(Father, who has thousands of worshippers,
is probably a virgin.)

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.940
Wait, wait, wait.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.256
Your name is Ploy, right?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.352
Please put the vase down.

00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.584
I won’t do anything to you.

00:04:57.608 --> 00:04:58.808
I don’t believe you.

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:00.000
They were chanting, “Wishing you
a joyous marriage, blessed with children.”

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.272
They were chanting, “Wishing you
a joyous marriage, blessed with children.”

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:02.624
I heard it.

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:04.620
Do you think I’ll let you do it easily?

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:06.720
Do it?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.320
Do what?

00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:10.136
Do that kind of stuff.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.256
Do that kind of stuff?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.912
What kind of stuff?

00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:18.912
Then why did you kidnap me
and put me in this dress?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.520
Because we are meant to be together.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.696
We fall in love, get married, and live together.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:34.424
After nine months, we will have a baby
who looks like you and me.

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:37.368
See? You are going to violate me.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.824
Wait.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.240
Violate you? What does it mean?

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.688
I’m confused.

00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:45.592
What are you talking about, Sangchan?

00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:50.360
When people want to make a baby,
they are doing this.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.440
Seriously?

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.680
You never knew about this stuff?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.064
I’m sorry

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.392
if what my followers did
causes any misunderstanding.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.344
You must be hungry.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.224
I’ll tell them to bring the food to our room.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.456
Hello.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.000
Please bring the food in.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.880
Please bring the food in.

00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:39.664
Please eat up.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.632
So you will regain your energy.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.520
Don’t try to fool me.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.928
I know you put sedatives in the food.

00:07:49.496 --> 00:07:51.500
What are you talking about, Sangchan?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.784
This is food. I don’t mess up with food.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.640
See?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.000
If you don’t trust me, you can have my plate.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.216
If you don’t trust me, you can have my plate.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.928
No.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.136
Who is Sangchan?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.512
Why do you keep calling me Sangchan?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.104
I’m sorry for calling you by the name.

00:08:18.952 --> 00:08:25.776
It’s because you look exactly like Sangchan,
my first love.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.992
(Back then, I didn’t have any friends.)

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.430
(I was always bullied.)

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.768
Go away.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.184
Go.

00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:55.464
(Sangchan was the only one)

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
(who was different from the other kids.)

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.768
(For me, she was my rock)

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.856
(that I had never had before.)

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.576
Oh.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.424
(My happy moment didn’t last long.)

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.400
(Unfortunately, I lost her.)

00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:39.100
(We didn’t have a chance to say goodbye.)

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.910
(She passed away due to an illness.)

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.472
(She had…

00:10:06.912 --> 00:10:08.910
The food really contain sedatives?

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.080
It cannot hurt me.

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:43.248
Can we talk?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.728
Hey, can you listen to me?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.528
Stop it.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.576
I’m just going to say that I’m a police officer.

00:10:58.608 --> 00:11:00.000
My name is Wutkrai Pantarak.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.744
My name is Wutkrai Pantarak.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.640
I’m an undercover agent.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.256
That was the first time I met Officer Wutkrai.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.632
How would I know
that he was an undercover agent?

00:11:19.664 --> 00:11:21.344
He was so good at playing his role.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.752
Your first encounter was interesting.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.480
How did you feel at the time?

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.152
To be honest, I felt relieved on one hand.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.720
He seemed like a good cop.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.720
But on the other hand, I…

00:11:40.752 --> 00:11:42.776
POLICE SUB-LIEUTENANT WUTKRAI PANTARAK

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.432
Did you put sedatives in the food?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.224
Yes, it’s to protect you.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.520
I’m sorry about the stabbing.

00:12:10.408 --> 00:12:13.008
This cannot hurt me.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.136
See?

00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:31.580
It cannot hurt me.

00:12:39.256 --> 00:12:41.260
I said the spell slightly wrong.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.896
I probably didn’t say the spell clearly.

00:13:13.304 --> 00:13:15.424
You are exaggerating it.

00:13:15.464 --> 00:13:17.736
I didn’t pass out because of the small wound.

00:13:17.768 --> 00:13:19.112
I didn’t exaggerate it.

00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:20.880
Your blood was pouring out all over the floor.

00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:22.104
Okay, okay.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.632
I know my subordinate well.

00:13:24.648 --> 00:13:26.088
That’s how he is.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.288
Did he tell you about his great-grandfather?

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.280
Of course.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.664
He told me that his ancestor was Khun Pan,
the legendary sorcerer.

00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:40.840
He followed his ancestors’ footsteps
to become a policeman.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.328
I’m a direct descendant of Khun Pan.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.856
What I want to say is that
my wound will heal even without your care.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.592
Right.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.824
You did well. You did well.

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:03.210
What are you going to do with them?

00:14:03.256 --> 00:14:04.920
When will you arrest them?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.544
If it were that easy, this cult would’ve been shut down a long time ago.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.936
Why?

00:14:12.984 --> 00:14:14.544
We got many evidences.

00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:16.392
I have several videos.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.128
I have them too.

00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:21.450
It’s not enough to arrest them.

00:14:21.664 --> 00:14:25.696
What? They set up a show to scam people.

00:14:25.736 --> 00:14:27.392
That’s not enough to arrest them?

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.160
You might think it doesn’t make sense.

00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:36.128
But what they do is not illegal.

00:14:36.152 --> 00:14:39.696
Because the followers are willing
to give the money to them.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:40.928
Huh?

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.072
That’s how our justice system works.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.264
But I believe that they are hiding something.

00:14:51.288 --> 00:14:53.260
That’s why I’m staying here.

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.740
Until I find concrete evidence.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.000
You reveal your identity and help me.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.392
You reveal your identity and help me.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.656
Will it be alright?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.088
Of course, it’s not alright.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.520
Revealing my identity to you is not in my plan.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.168
But I can’t stand seeing you in danger.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.856
That’s why I want you to leave this place.

00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:25.664
Let the police handle it.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.560
Thank you.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.312
But I have a favor to ask you.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.872
What is it?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.800
Can you help Phu escape with me?

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.480
Why?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080
Can’t you help me on this?

00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:55.832
It’s not that I can’t help you.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.870
But will he let me help him?

00:16:20.408 --> 00:16:23.712
ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
COME AND JOIN US.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.864
Comrade Phu, you already finished the book?

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.312
Yes, I finished it in just one night.

00:16:33.336 --> 00:16:36.184
This book has many valuable lessons.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.960
Comrade Phu, you did well.

00:16:38.992 --> 00:16:41.848
You did well. You did well.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.152
Thank you.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.504
Ploy.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.904
No, Mother.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.304
Phu, why are you calling me that?

00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:00.000
Stop joking.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.680
Stop joking.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.896
Ploy, do you have something to tell me?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.600
Why do you drag me here?

00:17:06.648 --> 00:17:08.664
I’m taking you out of this place.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.660
You don’t need to worry about finding evidence.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.448
There’s an officer…

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.408
Hold on.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.976
Why do we need to leave this place?

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.072
Because we are not safe here.

00:17:22.112 --> 00:17:24.784
We no longer need to stay here to find evidence.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.280
Ploy.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.872
I’ve stopped looking for evidence.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.408
I believe that this family is good.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.480
I get it.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.872
You may still have doubts about this family.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.064
If you read this book,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.048
you will understand everything.

00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:51.424
Phu, have you been brainwashed?

00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:52.472
Ploy.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.432
Why are you acting like this?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.712
Why don’t you give them a chance?

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:58.288
How can I give them a chance?

00:17:58.336 --> 00:18:00.000
Father is acting like a lunatic.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.750
Father is acting like a lunatic.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.704
Stop talking badly about Father.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.552
If you don’t want to join this family,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.712
then I have no choice.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.792
I have to tell everyone.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.568
Comrade Phupar, you have such a strong faith.

00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:29.104
Other comrades will be proud of you.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:46.992
My fellow comrades,
please congratulate Comrade Phupar.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.792
He passed the test of faith created by Mother.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.000
Comrade Phu, you did well.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.232
Comrade Phu, you did well.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:03.096
You did well. You did well.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.456
What the hell is going on?

00:19:40.496 --> 00:19:42.744
Why is Phu acting like that?

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.232
I’ve been staying here for a long time.

00:19:46.256 --> 00:19:48.744
I’ve seen countless people like him.

00:19:48.776 --> 00:19:50.832
Those who blindly believe in this cult.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.256
I think you should give up on him.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.504
You should leave this place alone, right now.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:16.592
You told me we need evidence to arrest them.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.080
Okay.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.056
I’ll stay and help you.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.408
If they want me to be Mother,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.840
I’ll be the ultimate Mother for them.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.432
Wait.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.408
Why are we in the same bed?

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.896
Don’t you remember about last night?

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.360
I remember that we had dinner.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.256
After that…

00:21:17.288 --> 00:21:18.112
We slept together.

00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:19.304
What?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.936
Why are you so surprised?

00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:26.848
Last night, you acted like a naïve young man.

00:21:26.904 --> 00:21:32.464
But you actually got impressive bedroom moves.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.592
After this, you need to take good care of me.

00:21:40.616 --> 00:21:41.872
Do you get it, honey?

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.328
Wait.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.504
What did you call me?

00:21:46.528 --> 00:21:47.576
Honey.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.064
If you don’t like it,

00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:53.888
I can call you babe.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.128
(Although I didn’t want to do it,)

00:22:07.176 --> 00:22:12.112
(I planned to make use of this position
as much as I can.)

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.552
(But I didn’t find anything
that can be used as evidence.)

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.416
(To tell you the truth,
I really wanted to give up.)

00:22:57.456 --> 00:23:00.000
(I started to doubt the officer might be wrong.)

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.904
(I started to doubt the officer might be wrong.)

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.664
(Until…)

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:25.528
I’m positive that
something is hiding in that book.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.336
Babe.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.352
Why do you always spend so long
in the bathroom?

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.880
Why do you take this book to the bathroom?

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.448
I…

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.640
I got used to it.

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.768
I have to read something
while I’m in the bathroom.

00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:47.168
It’s nothing.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.024
Really?

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.168
Can I see it?

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:57.720
This book is very boring.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.648
I don’t think you should read it.

00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:00.000
Why are you acting strange?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.144
Why are you acting strange?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.792
Are you lying to me?

00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:03.952
You are in the bathroom for a long time

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:05.280
because you’re chatting with another woman,
right?

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.736
What are you talking about, Sangchan?

00:24:08.768 --> 00:24:10.528
Don’t call me Sangchan.

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.184
What does that woman have that I don’t?

00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:14.976
I don’t have an affair.

00:24:16.032 --> 00:24:20.104
This book is just…

00:24:20.128 --> 00:24:21.304
See?

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.384
Babe, you have another woman.

00:24:23.408 --> 00:24:24.256
I’ll go find another man.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.544
Wait, Sangchan.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.904
Fine, you win.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.896
I have to tell you about it anyway.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:37.768
Here.

00:24:40.648 --> 00:24:42.650
Since I’m being good,

00:24:42.696 --> 00:24:44.376
what will you give me as a reward?

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.328
What do you want, babe?

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.488
Can I touch…

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.000
Touch your ass!

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.608
Touch your ass!

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.030
Don’t cross the line.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.464
Oh.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.816
Is he dead?

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.256
Father.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.272
Mother.

00:25:11.312 --> 00:25:12.416
Are you okay?

00:25:13.672 --> 00:25:14.872
Answer her.

00:25:14.896 --> 00:25:16.312
Say what?

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.576
Anything.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.016
It’s nothing.

00:25:20.072 --> 00:25:22.020
Father wants to try a kinky move.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.360
Huh?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.032
Goodness, you must feel tired.

00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:31.608
Can I bring you water to get refreshed?

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.200
You must be exhausted.

00:25:42.232 --> 00:25:45.880
You’re doing it in broad daylight.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.448
Father.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.360
What do you want for dinner?

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.000
Hello.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.312
Hello.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.920
Father.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.880
Soft-boiled eggs are good.

00:26:06.928 --> 00:26:09.392
But who said you can come in?

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.736
I’m sorry.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.096
Get out.

00:26:12.136 --> 00:26:14.528
Get out before I get mad.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.064
I hope you will have a baby soon.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.720
We almost got caught.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.472
This is brilliant.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.432
He hides a tablet in the book.

00:26:36.472 --> 00:26:38.816
There must be important evidence in it.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
The screen is locked.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.504
Let’s try the face scanning.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.584
He’s so heavy.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.776
It doesn’t work.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.216
What do we do?

00:27:04.744 --> 00:27:07.104
It probably can be unlocked
only with a passcode.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.880
It must be numbers that are important to him.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.000
What about Sangchan’s birthday?

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.344
She was his first and only love.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.400
I got it.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.960
As expected from a cop.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.432
How did you know her birthday?

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.104
No.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.840
The passcode is 1234.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.952
Yes, boss.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.320
I found evidence
linking money laundering to this cult.

00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:40.752
I’m sending the file to you.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.272
You can send a backup force to arrest them.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.072
Yes.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.592
Goodbye.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.584
How is it going?

00:27:52.856 --> 00:27:54.272
How is the file uploading?

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.744
The uploading is very slow.

00:27:56.768 --> 00:27:58.528
The internet signal is not good here.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.000
It will take several hours to upload it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.530
It will take several hours to upload it.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.896
It’s okay.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.056
The backup force is coming.

00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:09.760
You should get ready to leave this place.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.664
Thank you.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.616
You don’t need to thank me.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.984
It’s my job as a police officer.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.336
Fine.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.664
It was fun to work with you.

00:28:41.768 --> 00:28:43.770
Wutkrai!

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.728
Don’t tell me you are…

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.232
Are you the police?

00:28:57.272 --> 00:28:59.616
No, I’m not an undercover agent.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.832
Fine.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.264
Then you are her affair partner?

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.440
No, babe.

00:29:09.472 --> 00:29:11.032
It’s not what you think.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:25.344
I’m devastated to tell you
Mother cheats on me with Wutkrai.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.592
Those who can capture them,
I’ll make your wish come true.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.928
What should we do?

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.912
This is the slumber spell.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.896
It will send you
to meet your mother in your dream.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.576
What the hell are you doing?

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.160
I’ll leave the evidence with you.

00:29:57.184 --> 00:29:59.048
Go this way.

00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:00.000
Run straight through the woods.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.576
Run straight through the woods.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.392
Don’t make any turns.

00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:02.136
Do you hear me?

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:03.264
What about you?

00:30:03.288 --> 00:30:04.320
Don’t worry about me.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.528
Run.

00:30:18.576 --> 00:30:20.408
Go, now!

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.136
Let me go

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.616
Let me go

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.400
Where are you going?

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.808
Let me go.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.016
Mother.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.272
Mother, where are you going?

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.256
Mother.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.872
Mother, where are you going?

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.000
Let’s go back to our home.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.672
Let’s go back to our home.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.440
Let’s go back to our home.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.288
Let’s go back to our home.

00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:09.944
Let’s go back to our home.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:12.760
Let’s go back to our home.

How many vases are in this room?

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.456
Mother.

00:32:04.744 --> 00:32:05.896
Mother.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.344
Mother, where are you?

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.352
Mother, where are you?

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.864
Mother, where are you?

00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:14.936
Mother, where are you?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.592
Mother, where are you?

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:34.776
Ploy.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.360
Why did Father say
you’re having an affair with Wutkrai?

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.856
Why are they coming after you?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.152
Ploy, can you tell me what’s going on?

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.120
Phu, I got the evidence to expose this cult.

00:32:53.168 --> 00:32:55.536
They do more than scamming people.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.632
What do you mean?

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.832
Look.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.736
They created this cult
to launder money for the mafia.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.200
This is illegal.

00:33:14.944 --> 00:33:16.940
We need to get out of here.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.024
We need to submit the evidence to the police.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.304
So this damn cult will be shut down.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.104
Phu.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.888
What are you doing?

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.832
I’m just doing what I should do

00:33:41.856 --> 00:33:46.672
as a member of the Chantharusati Family.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.096
Phu.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.080
Are you out of your mind?

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.384
We have concrete evidence.

00:34:06.856 --> 00:34:08.860
Why are you helping this cult?

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.488
If the evidence is gone,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.176
the Chatharusati Family will remain innocent,
right?

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.424
What are you talking about?

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.744
Didn’t you say our job
is to reveal the truth to the public?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:33.544
My job right now
is to protect the Chatharusati Family.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.008
To be honest,

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.336
this is how our society is.

00:34:44.088 --> 00:34:46.090
No one cares to know the truth.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.032
Everyone only pays attention to my good looks.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.128
None of them cares to know who I really am.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.072
But this family,

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.256
they care to know who I am.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.776
I found my home, Ploy.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.552
Why, Ploy?

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.512
Why are you destroying my home?

00:35:16.544 --> 00:35:17.544
Phu!

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.448
This cult is driving you crazy.

00:35:20.488 --> 00:35:21.328
Do you know that?

00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:25.616
Ploy, you are just one of those
who like me because of my good looks.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.376
Lost for words, aren’t you?

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.144
You came here with me.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.944
So you can boast about it to others, right?

00:35:48.032 --> 00:35:50.030
In the end,

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.020
you are like those phonies out there.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.776
Phu.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.872
Are you done?

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.040
Yes.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.264
Good.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.496
What right do you have
to look down on other people’s love?

00:36:24.888 --> 00:36:26.890
You are so prejudiced.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.568
I have had a crush on you for ten years.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.000
Have you ever thought
you have more than just good looks?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.176
Have you ever thought
you have more than just good looks?

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.896
What’s wrong?

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.576
Did your bike chain fall off?

00:37:15.456 --> 00:37:16.536
I’ll help you.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.104
Done.

00:37:45.048 --> 00:37:47.050
At the time, I didn’t know

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.120
that you would become a singer.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.952
I like you.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.192
Because you were kind.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.864
You are prejudiced.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.024
So you think everyone is faking
when they are with you.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.888
The paint on your face is so fake.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.568
The chain lubricant back then was real.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.096
This is not true!

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.136
Sangchan.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.048
Don’t tell me.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.936
You also have an affair with Phupar.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.480
Don’t come near me.

00:39:35.592 --> 00:39:37.072
I’m petty.

00:39:37.096 --> 00:39:39.070
I will never forgive you.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.872
Are you trying to make up to me
by holding me?

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.496
Then I’ll forgive you.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.992
Let’s go back and make a baby.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.448
Shut up, douchebag.
You’re freaking annoying.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:20.240
This is how the story between me
and the Chatharusati Family ends.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.328
I think you know the rest of the story.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.544
I think we should call it a day.

00:41:38.568 --> 00:41:40.540
Ploy must be tired.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.792
Okay.

00:41:42.816 --> 00:41:45.392
Let’s call it a day.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.760
I want to thank you once again

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.096
for risking your life
to help me close this case.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.728
I didn’t help you for free.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.000
If I have an idea,
I’ll let you know how to pay me back.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.416
If I have an idea,
I’ll let you know how to pay me back.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.512
Are you going to have me pay a bribe?

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.872
You asked me to let Phupar
take credit for this case.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.720
Are you sure about it?

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.064
What happened?

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.192
Was there a fight?

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.472
Does anyone get hurt?

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.832
Yes, I’m sure.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:05.336
If Phu hadn’t asked me to join the cult,

00:43:05.368 --> 00:43:07.456
things would not have turned out this way.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.424
Are you sure?

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.848
I still have some hope in him.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.248
If that’s what you want, I’ll do it.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.456
His interrogation will take a while.

00:43:32.832 --> 00:43:34.830
You should go home and get some rest.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:41.112
If you stay here and go mad and kick officers, it would be chaotic.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.272
It hurts.

00:43:44.296 --> 00:43:45.664
I’m just joking.

00:43:45.688 --> 00:43:48.512
Didn’t you say
you are a descendant of Khun Pan?

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.392
You won’t die easily.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.808
Ploy.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.000
What, Officer?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.296
What, Officer?

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.176
Nothing.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.320
Get home safely.

00:44:11.264 --> 00:44:13.260
Don’t get into trouble.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:16.928
Yes.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.024
Lieutenant, why didn’t you tell her?

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.552
It’s not time yet.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.616
If I tell her, she will be worried.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.000
Thank you, Ploy.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.520
Thank you, Ploy.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.768
You are the real hero who saved my life.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.704
I saw on the internet.

00:45:10.744 --> 00:45:13.040
Father escaped from the police raid.

00:45:13.072 --> 00:45:14.632
Stop dodging the truth.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.248
Let’s start again.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.456
Shut up.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:27.192
The police believe that you are the main target.
