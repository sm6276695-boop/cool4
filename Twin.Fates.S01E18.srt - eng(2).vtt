(What Do You Like About Him?)

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.560
No...

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.400
No...

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.680
No...

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.200
No!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.880
No... No!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.040
Your Majesty?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.360
You're awake.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
I bet you've just had

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.880
a nightmare.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.840
Don't worry.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.640
I will find and capture

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.040
that traitor who kidnapped you.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.960
I shall give him

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
an ugly death.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.160
No, please look into it, Your Majesty.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.160
Chi Yu didn't kidnap me.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.760
Bai Li of the Silver Fox Clan tried to kill us

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.960
with her plot.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.160
Whether it's Chi Yu

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.880
or Bai Li,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.880
I won't allow anyone to hurt you.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.760
You belong to me.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.240
Your Majesty, what is this?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.560
Ever since I first met you,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.760
I've fallen for you.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.840
Until now.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.600
And I can't help myself.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.560
Since

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.920
you're not my cousin,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.960
be my lady, then.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.640
No, Your Majesty!

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.440
No!

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760
Your Majesty, go away!

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.640
Let go!

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.240
I'm running out of patience.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.360
I just want you.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.000
I want you now!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.040
Let go of me!

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.000
Let go of me!

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.160
This trick

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680
seems familiar to me.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.920
Haven't you witnessed
how powerful this trick is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.680
when you first met me

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.600
in the Silver Fox Palace?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.160
I only saw Lord Silver Fox

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.760
and the princes lying in blood.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.160
That means

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.920
they died from...

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.720
Did you really think

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.640
they died from killing one another

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.160
after going berserk?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.160
(Idiot.)

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.640
With them around,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.440
how could I inherit the throne?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.560
This is the Thousand-Soul Spell
of Silver Fox Clan.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760
Whoever under this spell

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.720
is short-tempered

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.760
and irrational.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.040
So I get to kill
without leaving a trace.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.880
(How cunning and cruel she is.)

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.680
Your power is admirable, Master.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.800
Yet a game of power

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.640
is always unpredictable, isn't it?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.840
Are you giving me a heads-up

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.720
or threatening me?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.560
I wouldn't dare to do so.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.760
Know your place.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.320
Remember.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.240
Your loyalty

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.520
guarantees the authority I grant to you.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.360
Yes, I shall bear that in mind.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560
Mu Lingxue.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.040
You think hiding yourself in the palace

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.160
will ensure your safety?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.760
(Loyalty?)

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.560
(Once I've got the Xuanzhu Jade,)

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.400
(I'll show you
what loyalty truly means.)

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.200
(I'll prove that with your blood.)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.920
You do fancy me,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.720
right?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.680
Well,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.680
you tried to get close to me
time after time.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.000
You thought I hadn't figured that out, huh?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.240
Chi Yu...

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.640
Your Majesty, please pardon us

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.880
for our tardiness!

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.920
My beloved lady.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.120
You're up.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.640
What do you want?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.560
I've been

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.640
wondering about this.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.160
What do you like

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.840
about him?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.320
Is it his face,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.160
these eyes,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.760
or

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.840
this mouth that bites people?

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.240
Stop it!

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.440
Ji Yuchen, have you lost your mind?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520
I have!

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.280
In what way I'm less than him?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.560
Why do you refuse to be my consort?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.240
Instead, you've been
fooling around with him!

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.000
Everything you've done with him,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.760
I'll do them with you.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.600
Mu Lingxue.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Just wait for me tonight.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.880
I

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.800
will perform better than him.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.960
In your dream!

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.200
Fine.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.920
I'll get rid of him, then!

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.320
No!

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.360
Are you threatening me

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.840
with your life because of him?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:11.960
Yes.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.480
If you insist on killing him,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.760
kill me too.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.360
Fine.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.160
I'll spare him.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.480
I want to marry you.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.280
I want us to be a loving couple.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.560
And I want him

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.200
to witness...

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.920
Guards.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.640
Prepare for my wedding

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.760
with Noble Consort Mu.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.040
Chi Yu...

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.560
(No way, I need to do something
to get him out of there.)

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.560
Miss.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.720
Are you looking for someone?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.200
How did you know that?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.777
(Immortal Xi)
Not only do I know

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:18.680
(Immortal Xi)
you're looking for someone,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.760
but I'm also aware
you're trying to save him.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.440
It's just that you don't know how.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.240
This concerns the secrets of the palace.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.320
Perhaps it has to do with the past.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.240
Please enlighten me, sir.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.480
The prince of Hong, Ji Yuchen,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.280
has been frail and sickly
since his childhood.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.360
Traitor Li Cang learned

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.040
that the Silver Fox Clan possess
a secret technique that could save his life.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.960
Thus, he struck a deal
with the King of Silver Fox Clan.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.200
He'd remain loyal to the Silver Fox Clan

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.080
in exchange for the Prince's life.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.360
And what saved the Prince's life

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.600
is none other than the primordial soul
of Yanlie of the Scarlet Flame Clan.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.400
Master.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.800
What should I do

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800
to save this Scarlet Flame Clan member
who's lost his sanity

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.840
as well as golden feather?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.960
Yanlie is the only one
who owns the golden feather

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.160
in this world.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.240
And only Ji Yuchen
could obtain the golden phoenix feather

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.640
from Yanlie.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.880
Ji Yuchen?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.960
How do I get the feather from him?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.120
You know

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.920
what Ji Yuchen
wants the most, don't you?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.760
It's you.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.600
I've been a fortune-teller for years,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.560
and I've only figured out one thing.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.880
Fate is all about

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.040
making a choice.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.480
(There's only one way)

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.040
(to get the golden phoenix feather)

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.360
(and help Chi Yu restore his sanity.)
