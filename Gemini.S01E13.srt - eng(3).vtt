(Gemini)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.520
(Episode 13)

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
Lu Zhao.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
What is it?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.240
Did you not expect me to return?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.480
Or did you not want me
to return at all?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.680
When I heard you were seriously ill,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.160
I even ignored the palace rules...

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.520
to rush back and visit you.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.840
Who would have thought...

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.880
that you and my husband...

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.280
would get pregnant behind my back?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.680
A child?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.000
Your child?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.440
How could you do this to me?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
What are you doing?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920
Lu Zhao.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.079
It was my idea.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.040
I wanted to bear an heir
for His Highness.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.320
I also did it
for your sake, Lu Zhao.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.560
If you want to hit someone,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.080
hit me then.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
All right.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.440
Your Highness.

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.679
You don't want her to suffer.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.159
Then you can suffer for her.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.240
- Lu Zhao, are you crazy?
- Yes.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.960
I've gone crazy.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.680
Ever since I came here,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.720
I've behaved myself.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.320
I even gave you all my assets.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.800
But what about you two?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.199
During my father's
mourning period...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600
and my training at Pilan Palace,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.159
you had an affair with my cousin.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.600
And you even got her pregnant!

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.879
You are the heartless one.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.080
You're even worse than an animal!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Lu Zhao.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.880
You haven't been able to bear a son
in all these years of our marriage.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040
That's considered
ending the family lineage.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.199
You drove your father to his death.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
That is a betrayal of virtue.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.800
You disrespect your husband.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.120
That is disrupting peace
in the family.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.440
You refuse to accept my concubine.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.960
That is jealousy.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800
You've committed four
of the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.400
I'm already more than benevolent...

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.920
for not divorcing you.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.320
How dare you try to divorce me?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.880
Then I shall commit
all seven grounds...

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.440
with pleasure.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.360
I'll sever all ties with you!

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
Are you done making a scene?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.720
That's enough.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.240
What outrageous behavior.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.040
Have you forgotten
the imperial family's dignity?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.520
While your wife
was undergoing training,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.320
you took in a concubine,
which violates propriety.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.480
Even if Lu Zhao is at fault,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920
both her parents are deceased.

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.120
She has no home to return to.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640
You...

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400
have no right to divorce her.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
Lu Zhao.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.160
The Prince of Chu
is indeed at fault.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.159
However, you are still childless...

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.880
and even tried to kill your husband.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.240
You are no longer fit
to be the Princess of Chu.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.880
You two were once husband and wife.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.360
I do not wish to see you
become enemies...

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.160
and disgrace the imperial family.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.720
I order you to divorce immediately.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.760
From now on, you may each marry
whomever you want,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.320
and you shall have nothing to do
with each other.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.440
Thank you, Ninth Uncle.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.160
You're right
to reprimand us, Ninth Uncle.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960
I will immediately...

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.800
draft the mutual divorce agreement.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.200
Lu Zhao and I will part amicably.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.400
Ninth Uncle, please allow...

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.080
Lu Zhao and I...

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.240
to say farewell in private.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.520
Lu Zhao, are you willing to do so?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
Yes.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200
We should indeed...

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.040
part...

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.600
amicably.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.200
I never sent a letter...

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320
to Pilan Palace.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.280
How did you know Xue Er was there?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
You don't deserve to know.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920
(Husband: Situ Xian, Wife: Lu Zhao)

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.480
The divorce agreement is here.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.880
If you want it,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.600
come and get it.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680
(Divorce Agreement)

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.800
Ninth Uncle is outside.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.560
How dare you be so presumptuous?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
What?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.040
Are you scared?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
You know martial arts?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.000
You are not Lu Zhao.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
Who are you?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560
(Divorce Agreement)

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.880
(Husband: Situ Xian, Wife: Lu Zhao)

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.280
I am Lu Zhao.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.480
I'm also the devil
who has come for your lives.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
By the way,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.920
if I hadn't stopped in time,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.479
I'm afraid...

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.120
we'd be preparing your funeral now.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.360
Do you think having Xiao Ren
on your side...

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.040
and playing a few tricks...

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.720
can take me down?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.360
Don't you know...

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.880
that soon enough,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.960
Xiao Ren will personally
place you in my bed?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.679
Then, you'll be begging me...

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680
like a dog.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.400
You'd better pray
that you can live a few days longer.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.040
Otherwise, once you're dead,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.800
your delusions will die with you.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.360
Lu Zhao.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600
Just you wait.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.160
Let's see how long
you can be arrogant.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.120
Thank you, Ninth Uncle,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.000
for upholding justice for me.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600
Lu Zhao.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.720
From now on, you are no longer
the Princess of Chu.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.400
You no longer need to return...

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.080
to Pilan Palace
for training with me.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.520
Your goal of using me
to get divorced...

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.520
has been achieved.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880
Ninth Uncle.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760
You...

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.080
I didn't expose you...

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.960
because you resemble Miao He.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.720
But you must remember this.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.680
If you gaze long into the abyss,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.000
the abyss also gazes into you.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.080
I hope you will be self-disciplined
and cautious in the future.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Take good care of yourself.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.120
Princess Miao He?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.520
She's Situ Xing Yuan's
deceased younger sister.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200
No wonder he was still willing
to help me...

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
even though he saw
through everything.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.720
I, Xiao Ren,
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080
Good.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.800
Great, Xiao Ren.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.479
You captured the King of Nanzhao
in one fell swoop,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.600
solving a major problem for me.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.120
You risked your life...

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.680
on this journey.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.640
I shall reward you handsomely.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.520
I will grant...

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880
whatever you desire.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.320
I do have one request...

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.080
that I hope Your Majesty
can grant me.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.560
Speak freely.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360
The criminal Liu Ming Fu
deceived Your Majesty...

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360
and committed suicide.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800
His residence has been confiscated.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.640
However, Liu Ming Fu's
daughter, Lu Zhao,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680
just divorced the Prince of Chu.

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.720
She is alone and helpless.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600
I humbly request Your Majesty...

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.200
to return the residence to Lu Zhao.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.960
That's all?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440
Yes, that is all.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320
Very well.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.920
Granted.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760
Let's go.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.120
I'll take you home.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.440
I don't have a home anymore.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920
Yes, you do.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.760
(Lu Manor)

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.680
Wasn't this mansion confiscated?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
From today onward,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.600
this is your home.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.520
You no longer
have to be bound by anyone.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.280
I've brought your nanny...

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.440
and your former servants
from the Liu household.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.280
From now on,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280
you'll have
your elders and friends...

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320
by your side.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
And...

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.200
And...

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.160
what?

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880
Lu Zhao.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.160
I didn't reclaim this mansion...

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.240
to trap you here.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.360
If there's anywhere
you want to go...

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.640
or anything you want to do,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.160
go ahead and do it.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960
I'll watch over things here.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.960
I'll be here
whenever you want to come back.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960
Thank you.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960
Go and take a look.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440
Okay.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200
Aren't you coming in?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.240
The people of the Xuntian Sect...

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680
have too much blood on our hands.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.439
All commoners
and even aristocrats...

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440
avoid us.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.679
Usually, when we visit
other people's homes,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.720
we use the side entrance.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.800
Whenever we use the main entrance,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200
it's usually...

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.840
for beheadings and confiscation.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.120
You're moving
into your new home today.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200
I'll just use the side entrance.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400
Go on.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Nonsense.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.800
The Xuntian Sect
is His Majesty's sword.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.080
The lives you take...

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.200
are to protect the people...

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.640
of this land.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.120
You are not a bad omen.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.440
Today, you helped me.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.119
There are many others...

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120
who will rely on you in the future.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.600
That is the meaning
of the Xuntian Sect's existence.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480
Xiao Ren.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
If it weren't for you,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760
I can't imagine...

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.120
when I'd be able
to see the light again.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Lu Zhao.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.400
I know better than anyone
what you've endured.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.320
You can start over now.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.000
I just don't want you...

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.920
to get dragged into the filth again.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.880
Are you sure you want to stay?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.000
Yes.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
Let's go.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.240
(Lu Manor)

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560
Thank you.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.320
I still have work to do
at the Xuntian Sect.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400
I'll go back first.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640
Okay.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760
Work is more important.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.720
He has done so much for me.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800
Shao Yao.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.960
Is he injured?

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.320
He gets hurt all the time.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.600
Miss, you don't have to worry.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320
The Liu manor was confiscated.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.959
Unless His Majesty gave his consent,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.960
there's no way
it could be reclaimed.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.840
I heard the good news
of the King of Nanzhao's capture.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.360
He wanted to reclaim this mansion.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.999
That's why he was so eager
to capture the King of Nanzhao.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Am I right?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.120
His actions...

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.320
and his thoughts...

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.840
I understand it all.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280
Miss.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.560
You don't have to worry so much.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
A few years ago,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.960
Master brought back
an injured baby pigeon.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.400
He cared for it meticulously
as if it were his own heart.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.720
Until one day,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.680
the pigeon grew up
and was about to fly away.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.600
The previous master had just passed.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480
That pigeon...

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.680
accompanied the Master
through his toughest times.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.280
Ling Su urged him...

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.040
to keep that pigeon.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.440
But Master said...

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.040
that he couldn't bear to see it
trapped in a cage.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.400
So he waited for a sunny day
to release the pigeon.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.520
But do you know what?

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.000
That pigeon returned
that very night.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.280
Because it had already decided...

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.200
that its home...

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200
is wherever the Master is.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.280
I suppose...

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.280
for a pigeon,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.320
soaring to the sky
and returning to its nest...

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.960
are not in conflict.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400
Miss.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.720
Those who truly love you...

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.600
will firmly stand
on the path you choose.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560
Lu Zhao.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.880
I didn't reclaim this mansion...

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.760
to trap you here.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.000
If there's anywhere
you want to go...

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320
or anything you want to do,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.280
go ahead and do it.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920
I'll watch over things here.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.960
I'll be here
whenever you want to come back.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.240
He never stopped me
from taking revenge.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.680
He never once put me in a dilemma.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.160
Perhaps...

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.080
we've always been on the same path.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600
Bad news, Ms. Lu.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.840
Master Xiao has suffered fatal injuries.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.280
Commander Ling asks you
to go and see him quickly.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.880
What?

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480
Xiao Ren!

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.720
I haven't had the chance
to tell you how I feel.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.680
Please be all right.
