Tighten this rope.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.480
- Hold it.
- Okay.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.720
Cuicui.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.800
Do you think
I've been treating you well?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.400
Though I'm a maid,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.000
you've treated me like your own sister.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.200
Good. Come here.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.560
Grab the rope here.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.880
Alright.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.920
Next,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.480
I need you to be my loyalist.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.280
What's a loyalist?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.440
A loyalist

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.640
is someone who acts decisively
at critical moments.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.520
Put it here. One, two, three.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800
Be careful.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.600
Pull it out a bit.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.960
Alright.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.080
Cuicui, hold this steady for me.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.120
My lady, be careful.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.000
I got this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.720
Xiaotang.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
What are you doing?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.440
Father.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.760
Come down right now.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880
This is utterly improper.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.680
Slowly, my lady.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.960
Father, I just

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.640
ate a bit too much

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.480
and wanted to walk it off

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.560
and get some air.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560
Mr. Qi has sent an invitation,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.800
asking to meet you
at the East Market at hour of Xu.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.560
He'll wait under the bridge tower.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.440
Father,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800
there's nothing between Mr. Qi and me.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.400
Please stop meddling.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.040
Cuicui.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.320
Don't be late.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.720
But...

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.080
Take this.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.880
Yes.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.480
If you don't show up

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.640
and offend the Qi family,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.800
I'll withdraw

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.600
the funds allocated to settle

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.760
Yes, Master.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.240
My lady.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.680
You should listen to your father

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.000
and meet Mr. Qi tonight.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.240
Otherwise, Mr. Li's accounts
can't be settled.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.520
My lady.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.600
Master is just angry now,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.520
but I'm sure

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.880
his temper will cool.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.200

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.920
Mr. Li truly cares for you.

Sir,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.480
I've proved that Hassan framed me

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.360
and Xiaotang.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.440
I have cleared her name as promised.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.960
Today, I came

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.000
to ask you to let me

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.080
marry Xiaotang again.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.880
I vow to protect her forever

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.840
and grow old

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.040
with her.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.880
When you were in prison,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.280
Xiaotang exhausted
every means to free you.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.160
She used my money

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.800
to resolve your financial troubles.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.680
That's how you remained
as the Li family head.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720
You said you'd protect her

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.200
and grow old with her,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.000
but you're still losing money.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.560
How can you protect her?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.840
Rest assured, sir.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.600
I will fully repay

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.000
the money you lent to me

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
within three months,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.080
with interest included.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.360
We will adopt

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.320
the highest interest rate in the market.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.800
That's more like it.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.880
Xiaotang and I share deep affection.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.040
Thank you for your approval.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.240
What did I approve?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.200
We were discussing the interest rate.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.240
If you truly wish to marry
my precious daughter,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.080
you must agree to one condition.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.240
Go ahead, sir.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.200
My family is immensely wealthy

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.480
but lacks male heirs.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.800
I want you to marry into our family

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.200
to continue the Wei lineage.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.720
In that case, you would reside

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.280
with your wife's family.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.320
Mr. Wei, this is too much.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.560
Marrying into another family
brings shame.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.240
We may not be as wealthy as you,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.320
but we're

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.000
a respected clan in Haiqing.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.120
How can our young master do that?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.320
Ning An, don't be rude.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.880
I'd like to see

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.000
what matters more to you,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.720
my daughter or your pride.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.040
Go home and think about it.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.680
Mr. Li, take care.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.400
Young Master, are you seriously
considering the request?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.080
You find it shameful?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.240
No.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.800
If you marry into the Wei family,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.720
I'll have to serve there.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.760
I'm wondering

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.440
if living under another's roof

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.200
would make us feel inferior.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.760
You're just worried about dignity.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.600
But I'm also troubled by another matter.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.680
What is it, sir?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.280
- We ran out of the wine?
- Not yet.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.720
Let's drink.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.520
Mr. Li.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.400
I really envy you.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
Really.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.680
You envy me?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.880
Miss Xiaotang remains
utterly devoted to you.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.800
How could I not be envious?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.520
When you were jailed,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.680
she ran around tirelessly.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.440
With her talents and wisdom,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.120
she outshines all ordinary women.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.560
The man she chooses

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.480
must be extraordinary.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.080
Do you think she loves me?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.400
Yeah.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.800
You know her so well.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120
Do you like her?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.520
Yes, I do.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.480
No, wait.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.040
It's not that.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.280
It's love.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.960
I love Miss Xiaotang

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.800
and I love you too.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.520
I love you both.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.440
Loving someone

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.496
is just like

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:46.680
loving mountains, rivers,
lakes, and seas.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.200
It's not bound by its origins,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.200
form, and species.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.560
I don't care about who they are.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.440
Nor do I care about worldly judgments.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.800
Love is simply human nature,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.200
unaffected by external influences.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.080
If the mountain won't come to me,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.440
I'll go to the mountain myself.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.200
Once I've chosen someone,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640
then love

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.640
becomes a natural and effortless matter.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.840
So according to you,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.360
I shouldn't be constrained
by external matters

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.640
and should follow my heart.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.120
Buddy.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.480
Here's a word of advice.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.640
May I find one true heart,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.080
till white-haired we remain true.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.360
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Qi.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.600
No problem.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.080
Cheers.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.480
Cheers.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.320
Master, Li Zixuan is here again.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.760
What does he want again?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.640
May I find one true heart,
till white-haired

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.760
we remain true.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.960
I am willing to
marry into the Wei family.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.320
What...

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.960
What are these?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.960
Madam Tang.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.360
These are our lady's dowry.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.880
Dowry?

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.000
Mr. Wei.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.720
Isn't Zixuan marrying
into the Wei family?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.800
Why did you bring
such an elaborate dowry?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.280
Is there a misunderstanding?

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.920
Not at all.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.560
There are my daughter's dowry.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.320
And it's doubled from last time.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.040
Then...

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.640
What about your request?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.000
I simply wanted to see

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.040
whether Zixuan would

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.240
set aside his pride for Xiaotang.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.840
He passed my trial unexpectedly well.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.600
I'm very pleased.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.520
I will allow

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.000
Xiaotang to remarry
into your family again.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.560
But we haven't made

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.440
any wedding preparations yet.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.640
That's not a problem.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.960
I've prepared everything.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.440
It seems fate still binds our families.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.040
In the end, we're in-laws again.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.920
Come on, carry these inside.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.480
Your lady is getting married.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.720
As the bride's family,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.920
you shouldn't be decorating this place.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.920
My lady asked me to do this

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.880
to absorb the festive atmosphere.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.040
Did she mention when she'll

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.080
arrange a match for you?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.320
Just do your work.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.160
Just tell me.

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:51.904
(Happiness)

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.640
Here's the Li family's heirloom

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.320
my mother left to me.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.360
It's yours now.

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:37.280
(Happiness)
